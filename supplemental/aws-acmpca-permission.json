  "description": "Grants permissions to the AWS Certificate Manager ( ACM ) service principal ( `acm.amazonaws.com` ) to perform [IssueCertificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_IssueCertificate.html) , [GetCertificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_GetCertificate.html) , and [ListPermissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_ListPermissions.html) actions on a CA. These actions are needed for the ACM principal to renew private PKI certificates requested through ACM and residing in the same AWS account as the CA.\n\n**About permissions** - If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in the same account, you can use `AWS::ACMPCA::Permission` to grant permissions for ACM to carry out automatic certificate renewals.\n- For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM service principal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list permissions.\n- If the private CA and the ACM certificates reside in different accounts, then permissions cannot be used to enable automatic renewals. Instead, the ACM certificate owner must set up a resource-based policy to enable cross-account issuance and renewals. For more information, see [Using a Resource Based Policy with AWS Private CA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-rbp.html) .\n\n> To update an `AWS::ACMPCA::Permission` resource, you must first delete the existing permission resource from the CloudFormation stack and then create a new permission resource with updated properties.",
