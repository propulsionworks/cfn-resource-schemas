  "description": "Creates an *investigation group* in your account. Creating an investigation group is a one-time setup task for each Region in your account. It is a necessary task to be able to perform investigations.\n\nSettings in the investigation group help you centrally manage the common properties of your investigations, such as the following:\n\n- Who can access the investigations\n- Whether investigation data is encrypted with a customer managed AWS Key Management Service key.\n- How long investigations and their data are retained by default.\n\nCurrently, you can have one investigation group in each Region in your account. Each investigation in a Region is a part of the investigation group in that Region\n\nTo create an investigation group and set up Amazon Q Developer operational investigations, you must be signed in to an IAM principal that has the either the `AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy` or the `AdministratorAccess` IAM policy attached, or to an account that has similar permissions.\n\n> You can optionally configure CloudWatch alarms to start investigations and add events to investigations. The examples section on this page demonstrates creating an investigation group and an alarm at the same time.\n> \n> For more information about configuring CloudWatch alarms to work with Amazon Q Developer operational investigations, see",
