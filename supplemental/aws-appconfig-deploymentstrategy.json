A deployment strategy defines important criteria for rolling out your configuration to the designated targets. A deployment strategy includes: the overall duration required, a percentage of targets to receive the deployment during each interval, an algorithm that defines how percentage grows, and bake time.\n\nAWS AppConfig requires that you create resources and deploy a configuration in the following order:\n\n- Create an application\n- Create an environment\n- Create a configuration profile\n- Choose a pre-defined deployment strategy or create your own\n- Deploy the configuration\n\nFor more information, see [AWS AppConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/what-is-appconfig.html) in the *AWS AppConfig User Guide* .",

      "description": "The algorithm used to define how percentage grows over time. AWS AppConfig supports the following growth types:\n\n*Linear* : For this type, AWS AppConfig processes the deployment by dividing the total number of targets by the value specified for `Step percentage` . For example, a linear deployment that uses a `Step percentage` of 10 deploys the configuration to 10 percent of the hosts. After those deployments are complete, the system deploys the configuration to the next 10 percent. This continues until 100% of the targets have successfully received the configuration.\n\n*Exponential* : For this type, AWS AppConfig processes the deployment exponentially using the following formula: `G*(2^N)` . In this formula, `G` is the growth factor specified by the user and `N` is the number of steps until the configuration is deployed to all targets. For example, if you specify a growth factor of 2, then the system rolls out the configuration as follows:\n\n`2*(2^0)`\n\n`2*(2^1)`\n\n`2*(2^2)`\n\nExpressed numerically, the deployment rolls out as follows: 2% of the targets, 4% of the targets, 8% of the targets, and continues until the configuration has been deployed to all targets.",
