  "description": "The `AWS::AppConfig::Environment` resource creates an environment, which is a logical deployment group of AWS AppConfig targets, such as applications in a `Beta` or `Production` environment. You define one or more environments for each AWS AppConfig application. You can also define environments for application subcomponents such as the `Web` , `Mobile` and `Back-end` components for your application. You can configure Amazon CloudWatch alarms for each environment. The system monitors alarms during a configuration deployment. If an alarm is triggered, the system rolls back the configuration.\n\nAWS AppConfig requires that you create resources and deploy a configuration in the following order:\n\n- Create an application\n- Create an environment\n- Create a configuration profile\n- Choose a pre-defined deployment strategy or create your own\n- Deploy the configuration\n\nFor more information, see [AWS AppConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/what-is-appconfig.html) in the *AWS AppConfig User Guide* .",
