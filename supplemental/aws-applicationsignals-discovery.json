  "description": "> If you have existing `AWS::ApplicationSignals::Discovery` resources that were created prior to the Application Map release, you will need to delete and recreate these resources in your account to enable Application Map. \n\nEnables this AWS account to be able to use CloudWatch Application Signals by creating the `AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchApplicationSignals` service-linked role. This service-linked role has the following permissions:\n\n- `xray:GetServiceGraph`\n- `logs:StartQuery`\n- `logs:GetQueryResults`\n- `cloudwatch:GetMetricData`\n- `cloudwatch:ListMetrics`\n- `tag:GetResources`\n- `autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups`\n\nA service-linked CloudTrail event channel is created to process CloudTrail events and return change event information. This includes last deployment time, userName, eventName, and other event metadata.\n\nAfter completing this step, you still need to instrument your Java and Python applications to send data to Application Signals.
