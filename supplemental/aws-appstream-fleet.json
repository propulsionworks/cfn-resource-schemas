Users are considered idle when they stop providing keyboard or mouse input during their streaming session. File uploads and downloads, audio in, audio out, and pixels changing do not qualify as user activity. If users continue to be idle after the time interval in `IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds` elapses, they are disconnected.\n\nTo prevent users from being disconnected due to inactivity, specify a value of 0. Otherwise, specify a value between 60 and 36000.\n\nIf you enable this feature, we recommend that you specify a value that corresponds exactly to a whole number of minutes (for example, 60, 120, and 180). If you don't do this, the value is rounded to the nearest minute. For example, if you specify a value of 70, users are disconnected after 1 minute of inactivity.

For example, if you specify a value of 90, users are disconnected after 2 minutes of inactivity.",
