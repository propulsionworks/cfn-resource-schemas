  "description": "Use resource-based policies to grant permissions to other AWS accounts or services to access your workspace.\n\nOnly Prometheus-compatible APIs can be used for workspace sharing. You can add non-Prometheus-compatible APIs to the policy, but they will be ignored. For more information, see [Prometheus-compatible APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-APIReference-Prometheus-Compatible-Apis.html) in the *Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus User Guide* .\n\nIf your workspace uses customer-managed AWS KMS keys for encryption, you must grant the principals in your resource-based policy access to those AWS KMS keys. You can do this by creating AWS KMS grants. For more information, see [CreateGrant](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateGrant.html) in the *AWS KMS API Reference* and [Encryption at rest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/encryption-at-rest-Amazon-Service-Prometheus.html) in the *Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus User Guide* .\n\nFor more information about working with IAM , see [Using Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html) in the *Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus User Guide* .",
