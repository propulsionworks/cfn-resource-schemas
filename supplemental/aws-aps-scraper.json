  "description": "A scraper is a fully-managed agentless collector that discovers and pulls metrics automatically. A scraper pulls metrics from Prometheus-compatible sources within an Amazon EKS cluster, and sends them to your Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace. Scrapers are flexible. You can configure the scraper to control what metrics are collected, the frequency of collection, what transformations are applied to the metrics, and more.\n\nAn IAM role will be created for you that Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus uses to access the metrics in your cluster. You must configure this role with a policy that allows it to scrape metrics from your cluster. For more information, see [Configuring your Amazon EKS cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-collector-how-to.html#AMP-collector-eks-setup) in the *Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus User Guide* .\n\nThe `scrapeConfiguration` parameter contains the YAML configuration for the scraper.\n\n> For more information about collectors, including what metrics are collected, and how to configure the scraper, see [Using an AWS managed collector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-collector-how-to.html) in the *Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus User Guide* .",
