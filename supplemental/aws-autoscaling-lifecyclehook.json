  "description": "The `AWS::AutoScaling::LifecycleHook` resource specifies lifecycle hooks for an Auto Scaling group. These hooks let you create solutions that are aware of events in the Auto Scaling instance lifecycle, and then perform a custom action on instances when the corresponding lifecycle event occurs. A lifecycle hook provides a specified amount of time (one hour by default) to wait for the action to complete before the instance transitions to the next state.\n\nUse lifecycle hooks to prepare new instances for use or to delay them from being registered behind a load balancer before their configuration has been applied completely. You can also use lifecycle hooks to prepare running instances to be terminated by, for example, downloading logs or other data.\n\nFor more information, see [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .",
