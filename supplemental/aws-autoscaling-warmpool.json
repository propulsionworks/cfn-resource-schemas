  "description": "The `AWS::AutoScaling::WarmPool` resource creates a pool of pre-initialized EC2 instances that sits alongside the Auto Scaling group. Whenever your application needs to scale out, the Auto Scaling group can draw on the warm pool to meet its new desired capacity.\n\nWhen you create a warm pool, you can define a minimum size. When your Auto Scaling group scales out and the size of the warm pool shrinks, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches new instances into the warm pool to maintain its minimum size.\n\nFor more information, see [Warm pools for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-warm-pools.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .\n\n> CloudFormation supports the `UpdatePolicy` attribute for Auto Scaling groups. During an update, if `UpdatePolicy` is set to `AutoScalingRollingUpdate` , CloudFormation replaces `InService` instances only. Instances in the warm pool are not replaced. The difference in which instances are replaced can potentially result in different instance configurations after the stack update completes. If `UpdatePolicy` is set to `AutoScalingReplacingUpdate` , you do not encounter this issue because CloudFormation replaces both the Auto Scaling group and the warm pool.",

If you specify a value for `MaxGroupPreparedCapacity` , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the difference between the `MaxGroupPreparedCapacity` and the desired capacity instead.\n> \n> The size of the warm pool is dynamic. Only when `MaxGroupPreparedCapacity` and `MinSize` are set to the same value does the warm pool have an absolute size. \n\nIf the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group is higher than the `MaxGroupPreparedCapacity` , the capacity of the warm pool is 0, unless you specify a value for `MinSize` .
