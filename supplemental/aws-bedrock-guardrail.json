Guardrails support the following content filters to detect and filter harmful user inputs and FM-generated outputs.\n\n- *Hate* – Describes language or a statement that discriminates, criticizes, insults, denounces, or dehumanizes a person or group on the basis of an identity (such as race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, ability, and national origin).\n- *Insults* – Describes language or a statement that includes demeaning, humiliating, mocking, insulting, or belittling language. This type of language is also labeled as bullying.\n- *Sexual* – Describes language or a statement that indicates sexual interest, activity, or arousal using direct or indirect references to body parts, physical traits, or sex.\n- *Violence* – Describes language or a statement that includes glorification of or threats to inflict physical pain, hurt, or injury toward a person, group or thing.\n\nContent filtering depends on the confidence classification of user inputs and FM responses across each of the four harmful categories. All input and output statements are classified into one of four confidence levels (NONE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) for each harmful category. For example, if a statement is classified as *Hate* with HIGH confidence, the likelihood of the statement representing hateful content is high. A single statement can be classified across multiple categories with varying confidence levels. For example, a single statement can be classified as *Hate* with HIGH confidence, *Insults* with LOW confidence, *Sexual* with NONE confidence, and *Violence* with MEDIUM confidence.\n\nFor more information, see [Guardrails content filters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails-filters.html) .",

It is also used for some purposes in the UK tax system.\n\nThe number is nine digits long and starts with two letters, followed by six numbers and one letter. A NINO can be formatted with a space or a dash after the two letters and after the second, forth, and sixth digits.\n- *UK_UNIQUE_TAXPAYER_REFERENCE_NUMBER*\n\nA UK Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) is a 10-digit number that identifies a taxpayer or a business.\n- *Custom*\n\n- *Regex filter* - You can use a regular expressions to define patterns for a guardrail to recognize and act upon such as serial number, booking ID etc..",

  "description": "Creates a guardrail to detect and filter harmful content in your generative AI application.\n\nAmazon Bedrock Guardrails provides the following safeguards (also known as policies) to detect and filter harmful content:\n\n- *Content filters* - Detect and filter harmful text or image content in input prompts or model responses. Filtering is done based on detection of certain predefined harmful content categories: Hate, Insults, Sexual, Violence, Misconduct and Prompt Attack. You also can adjust the filter strength for each of these categories.\n- *Denied topics* - Define a set of topics that are undesirable in the context of your application. The filter will help block them if detected in user queries or model responses.\n- *Word filters* - Configure filters to help block undesirable words, phrases, and profanity (exact match). Such words can include offensive terms, competitor names, etc.\n- *Sensitive information filters* - Configure filters to help block or mask sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information (PII), or custom regex in user inputs and model responses. Blocking or masking is done based on probabilistic detection of sensitive information in standard formats in entities such as SSN number, Date of Birth, address, etc. This also allows configuring regular expression based detection of patterns for identifiers.\n- *Contextual grounding check* - Help detect and filter hallucinations in model responses based on grounding in a source and relevance to the user query.\n\nFor more information, see [How Amazon Bedrock Guardrails works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails-how.html) .",
