Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.\n- Tag keys and values are case sensitive.\n- Do not use `aws:` , `AWS:` , or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has `aws` as its prefix but the key does not, then Clean Rooms ML considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of `aws` do not count against your tags per resource limit.",
