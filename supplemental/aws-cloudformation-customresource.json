  "description": "The `AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource` resource creates a custom resource. Custom resources provide a way for you to write custom provisioning logic into your CloudFormation templates and have CloudFormation run it anytime you create, update (if you changed the custom resource), or delete a stack.\n\nFor more information, see [Create custom provisioning logic with custom resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources.html) in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* .\n\n> If you use AWS PrivateLink , custom resources in the VPC must have access to CloudFormation -specific Amazon S3 buckets. Custom resources must send responses to a presigned Amazon S3 URL. If they can't send responses to Amazon S3 , CloudFormation won't receive a response and the stack operation fails. For more information, see [Access CloudFormation using an interface endpoint ( AWS PrivateLink )](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/vpc-interface-endpoints.html) in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* .",
