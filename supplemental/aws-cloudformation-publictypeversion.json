If it does, CloudFormation then publishes it to the registry as a public third-party extension in this Region. Public extensions are available for use by all CloudFormation users.\n\n- For resource types, testing includes passing all contracts tests defined for the type.\n- For modules, testing includes determining if the module's model meets all necessary requirements.\n\nFor more information, see [Testing your public extension prior to publishing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/publish-extension.html#publish-extension-testing) in the *AWS CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CLI) User Guide* .\n\nIf you don't specify a version, CloudFormation uses the default version of the extension in your account and Region for testing.\n\nTo perform testing, CloudFormation assumes the execution role specified when the type was registered.\n\nAn extension must have a test status of `PASSED` before it can be published.
