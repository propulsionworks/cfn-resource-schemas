  "description": "The `AWS::CloudFormation::WaitCondition` resource provides a way to coordinate stack resource creation with configuration actions that are external to the stack creation or to track the status of a configuration process. In these situations, we recommend that you associate a `CreationPolicy` attribute with the wait condition instead of using a wait condition handle. For more information and an example, see [CreationPolicy attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-creationpolicy.html) in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* . If you use a `CreationPolicy` with a wait condition, don't specify any of the wait condition's properties.\n\n> If you use AWS PrivateLink , resources in the VPC that respond to wait conditions must have access to CloudFormation , specific Amazon S3 buckets. Resources must send wait condition responses to a presigned Amazon S3 URL. If they can't send responses to Amazon S3 , CloudFormation won't receive a response and the stack operation fails. For more information, see [Access CloudFormation using an interface endpoint ( AWS PrivateLink )](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/vpc-interface-endpoints.html) in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* . > For Amazon EC2 and Auto Scaling resources, we recommend that you use a `CreationPolicy` attribute instead of wait conditions. Add a `CreationPolicy` attribute to those resources, and use the `cfn-signal` helper script to signal when an instance creation process has completed successfully.",
