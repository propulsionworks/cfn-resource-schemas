  "description": "The `AWS::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm` type creates or updates a composite alarm. When you create a composite alarm, you specify a rule expression for the alarm that takes into account the alarm states of other alarms that you have created. The composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if all conditions of the rule are met.\n\nThe alarms specified in a composite alarm's rule expression can include metric alarms and other composite alarms.\n\nUsing composite alarms can reduce alarm noise. You can create multiple metric alarms, and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts only for the composite alarm. For example, you could create a composite alarm that goes into ALARM state only when more than one of the underlying metric alarms are in ALARM state.\n\nWhen this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to INSUFFICIENT_DATA. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed. For a composite alarm, this initial time after creation is the only time that the alarm can be in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state.\n\nWhen you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.",

You can use parenthesis to logically group the functions in your expression.\n\nYou can use either alarm names or ARNs to reference the other alarms that are to be evaluated.\n\nFunctions can include the following:\n\n- ALARM(\"alarm-name or alarm-ARN\") is TRUE if the named alarm is in ALARM state.\n- OK(\"alarm-name or alarm-ARN\") is TRUE if the named alarm is in OK state.\n- INSUFFICIENT_DATA(\"alarm-name or alarm-ARN\") is TRUE if the named alarm is in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state.\n- TRUE always evaluates to TRUE.\n- FALSE always evaluates to FALSE.\n\nTRUE and FALSE are useful for testing a complex AlarmRule structure, and for testing your alarm actions.\n\nFor more information about `AlarmRule` syntax, see [PutCompositeAlarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_PutCompositeAlarm.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch API Reference* .",
