If it is specified, CodePipeline ignores it. This is because CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value.\n- For source code in an CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the buildspec file (for example, `https://git-codecommit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name>` ).\n- For source code in an Amazon S3 input bucket, one of the following.\n\n- The path to the ZIP file that contains the source code (for example, `<bucket-name>/<path>/<object-name>.zip` ).\n- The path to the folder that contains the source code (for example, `<bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/` ).\n- For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub *Authorize application* page, for *Organization access* , choose *Request access* next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose *Authorize application* . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the `source` object, set the `auth` object's `type` value to `OAUTH` .\n- For source code in an GitLab or self-managed GitLab repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your GitLab account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitLab, on the Connections *Authorize application* page, choose *Authorize* . Then on the AWS CodeConnections *Create GitLab connection* page, choose *Connect to GitLab* . (After you have connected to your GitLab account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to override the default connection and use this connection instead, set the `auth` object's `type` value to `CODECONNECTIONS` in the `source` object.\n- For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. Use the AWS CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket *Confirm access to your account* page, choose *Grant access* . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to use this connection, in the `source` object, set the `auth` object's `type` value to `OAUTH` .\n\nIf you specify `CODEPIPELINE` for the `Type` property, don't specify this property. For all of the other types, you must specify `Location` .",
