  "description": "Creates a new set of branding settings for a user pool style and associates it with an app client. This operation is the programmatic option for the creation of a new style in the branding designer.\n\nProvides values for UI customization in a `Settings` JSON object and image files in an `Assets` array. To send the JSON object `Document` type parameter in `Settings` , you might need to update to the most recent version of your AWS SDK.\n\nThis operation has a 2-megabyte request-size limit and include the CSS settings and image assets for your app client. Your branding settings might exceed 2MB in size. Amazon Cognito doesn't require that you pass all parameters in one request and preserves existing style settings that you don't specify. If your request is larger than 2MB, separate it into multiple requests, each with a size smaller than the limit.\n\nAs a best practice, modify the output of [DescribeManagedLoginBrandingByClient](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeManagedLoginBrandingByClient.html) into the request parameters for this operation. To get all settings, set `ReturnMergedResources` to `true` .
