  "description": "Creates terms documents for the requested app client. When Terms and conditions and Privacy policy documents are configured, the app client displays links to them in the sign-up page of managed login for the app client.\n\nYou can provide URLs for terms documents in the languages that are supported by [managed login localization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-managed-login.html#managed-login-localization) . Amazon Cognito directs users to the terms documents for their current language, with fallback to `default` if no document exists for the language.\n\nEach request accepts one type of terms document and a map of language-to-link for that document type. You must provide both types of terms documents in at least one language before Amazon Cognito displays your terms documents. Supply each type in separate requests.\n\nFor more information, see [Terms documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-managed-login.html#managed-login-terms-documents) .\n\n> Amazon Cognito evaluates AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.\n> \n> **Learn more** - [Signing AWS API Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-signing.html)\n> - [Using the Amazon Cognito user pools API and user pool endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pools-API-operations.html)",
