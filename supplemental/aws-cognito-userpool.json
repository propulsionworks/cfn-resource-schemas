When you use the default option, Amazon Cognito allows only a limited number of emails each day for your user pool. For typical production environments, the default email limit is less than the required delivery volume. To achieve a higher delivery volume, specify DEVELOPER to use your Amazon SES email configuration.\n\nTo look up the email delivery limit for the default option, see [Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/limits.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide* .\n\nThe default FROM address is `no-reply@verificationemail.com` . To customize the FROM address, provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon SES verified email address for the `SourceArn` parameter.\n- **DEVELOPER** - When Amazon Cognito emails your users, it uses your Amazon SES configuration. Amazon Cognito calls Amazon SES on your behalf to send email from your verified email address. When you use this option, the email delivery limits are the same limits that apply to your Amazon SES verified email address in your AWS account .\n\nIf you use this option, provide the ARN of an Amazon SES verified email address for the `SourceArn` parameter.\n\nBefore Amazon Cognito can email your users, it requires additional permissions to call Amazon SES on your behalf. When you update your user pool with this option, Amazon Cognito creates a *service-linked role* , which is a type of role in your AWS account . This role contains the permissions that allow you to access Amazon SES and send email messages from your email address. For more information about the service-linked role that Amazon Cognito creates, see [Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon Cognito](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide* .",

Amazon Cognito uses the email address that you provide in one of the following ways, depending on the value that you specify for the `EmailSendingAccount` parameter:\n\n- If you specify `COGNITO_DEFAULT` , Amazon Cognito uses this address as the custom FROM address when it emails your users using its built-in email account.\n- If you specify `DEVELOPER` , Amazon Cognito emails your users with this address by calling Amazon SES on your behalf.\n\nThe Region value of the `SourceArn` parameter must indicate a supported AWS Region of your user pool.
