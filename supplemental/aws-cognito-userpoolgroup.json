If a user belongs to two or more groups, it is the group with the lowest precedence value whose role ARN is given in the user's tokens for the `cognito:roles` and `cognito:preferred_role` claims.\n\nTwo groups can have the same `Precedence` value. If this happens, neither group takes precedence over the other. If two groups with the same `Precedence` have the same role ARN, that role is used in the `cognito:preferred_role` claim in tokens for users in each group. If the two groups have different role ARNs, the `cognito:preferred_role` claim isn't set in users' tokens.\n\nThe default `Precedence` value is null. The maximum `Precedence` value is `2^31-1` .",
