This payload contains a `clientMetadata` attribute that provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your request. In your function code, you can process the `clientMetadata` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.\n\nTo review the Lambda trigger types that Amazon Cognito invokes at runtime with API requests, see [Connecting API actions to Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-working-with-lambda-triggers.html#lambda-triggers-by-event) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide* .\n\n> When you use the `ClientMetadata` parameter, note that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:\n> \n> - Store the `ClientMetadata` value. This data is available only to AWS Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the `ClientMetadata` parameter serves no purpose.\n> - Validate the `ClientMetadata` value.\n> - Encrypt the `ClientMetadata` value.
