For information on how many AWS Config rules you can have per account, see [*Service Limits*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/configlimits.html) in the *AWS Config Developer Guide* .\n\nThere are two types of rules: *AWS Config Managed Rules* and *AWS Config Custom Rules* . You can use the `ConfigRule` resource to create both AWS Config Managed Rules and AWS Config Custom Rules.\n\nAWS Config Managed Rules are predefined, customizable rules created by AWS Config . For a list of managed rules, see [List of AWS Config Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html) . If you are adding an AWS Config managed rule, you must specify the rule's identifier for the `SourceIdentifier` key.\n\nAWS Config Custom Rules are rules that you create from scratch. There are two ways to create AWS Config custom rules: with Lambda functions ( [AWS Lambda Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/gettingstarted-concepts.html#gettingstarted-concepts-function) ) and with Guard ( [Guard GitHub Repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard) ), a policy-as-code language. AWS Config custom rules created with AWS Lambda are called *AWS Config Custom Lambda Rules* and AWS Config custom rules created with Guard are called *AWS Config Custom Policy Rules* .\n\nIf you are adding a new AWS Config Custom Lambda rule, you first need to create an AWS Lambda function that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources. When you use the `ConfigRule` resource to add a Custom Lambda rule to AWS Config , you must specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that AWS Lambda assigns to the function. You specify the ARN in the `SourceIdentifier` key. This key is part of the `Source` object, which is part of the `ConfigRule` object.\n\nFor any new AWS Config rule that you add, specify the `ConfigRuleName` in the `ConfigRule` object. Do not specify the `ConfigRuleArn` or the `ConfigRuleId` . These values are generated by AWS Config for new rules.\n\nIf you are updating a rule that you added previously, you can specify the rule by `ConfigRuleName` , `ConfigRuleId` , or `ConfigRuleArn` in the `ConfigRule` data type that you use in this request.\n\nFor more information about developing and using AWS Config rules, see [Evaluating Resources with AWS Config Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config.html) in the *AWS Config Developer Guide* .",
