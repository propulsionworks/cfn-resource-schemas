This value also sets how often AWS Config invokes evaluations for AWS Config rules.\n- The value for the `MaximumExecutionFrequency` parameter, which sets the maximum frequency with which AWS Config invokes evaluations for the rule. For more information, see [ConfigRule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_ConfigRule.html) .\n\nIf the `deliveryFrequency` value is less frequent than the `MaximumExecutionFrequency` value for a rule, AWS Config invokes the rule only as often as the `deliveryFrequency` value.\n\n- For example, you want your rule to run evaluations when AWS Config delivers the configuration snapshot.\n- You specify the `MaximumExecutionFrequency` value for `Six_Hours` .\n- You then specify the delivery channel `deliveryFrequency` value for `TwentyFour_Hours` .\n- Because the value for `deliveryFrequency` is less frequent than `MaximumExecutionFrequency` , AWS Config invokes evaluations for the rule every 24 hours.\n\nYou should set the `MaximumExecutionFrequency` value to be at least as frequent as the `deliveryFrequency` value. You can view the `deliveryFrequency` value by using the `DescribeDeliveryChannnels` action.\n\nTo update the `deliveryFrequency` with which AWS Config delivers your configuration snapshots, use the `PutDeliveryChannel` action.",

  "description": "Specifies a delivery channel object to deliver configuration information to an Amazon S3 bucket and Amazon SNS topic.\n\nBefore you can create a delivery channel, you must create a configuration recorder. You can use this action to change the Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon SNS topic of the existing delivery channel. To change the Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon SNS topic, call this action and specify the changed values for the S3 bucket and the SNS topic. If you specify a different value for either the S3 bucket or the SNS topic, this action will keep the existing value for the parameter that is not changed.\n\n> In the China (Beijing) Region, when you call this action, the Amazon S3 bucket must also be in the China (Beijing) Region. In all the other regions, AWS Config supports cross-region and cross-account delivery channels. \n\nYou can have only one delivery channel per region per AWS account, and the delivery channel is required to use AWS Config .\n\n> AWS Config does not support the delivery channel to an Amazon S3 bucket bucket where object lock is enabled. For more information, see [How S3 Object Lock works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-overview.html) . \n\nWhen you create the delivery channel, you can specify; how often AWS Config delivers configuration snapshots to your Amazon S3 bucket (for example, 24 hours), the S3 bucket to which AWS Config sends configuration snapshots and configuration history files, and the Amazon SNS topic to which AWS Config sends notifications about configuration changes, such as updated resources, AWS Config rule evaluations, and when AWS Config delivers the configuration snapshot to your S3 bucket. For more information, see [Deliver Configuration Items](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/how-does-config-work.html#delivery-channel) in the AWS Config Developer Guide.\n\n> To enable AWS Config , you must create a configuration recorder and a delivery channel.
