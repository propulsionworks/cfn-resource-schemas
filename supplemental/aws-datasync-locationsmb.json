You also can configure DataSync to use a specific SMB version, but we recommend doing this only if DataSync has trouble negotiating with the SMB file server automatically.\n\nThese are the following options for configuring the SMB version:\n\n- `AUTOMATIC` (default): DataSync and the SMB file server negotiate the highest version of SMB that they mutually support between 2.1 and 3.1.1.\n\nThis is the recommended option. If you instead choose a specific version that your file server doesn't support, you may get an `Operation Not Supported` error.\n- `SMB3` : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 3.0.2.\n- `SMB2` : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 2.1.\n- `SMB2_0` : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 2.0.\n- `SMB1` : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 1.0.\n\n> The `SMB1` option isn't available when [creating an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP location](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_CreateLocationFsxOntap.html) .",
