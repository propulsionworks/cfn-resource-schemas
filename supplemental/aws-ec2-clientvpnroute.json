Each route in the route table specifies the path for traffic to specific resources or networks.\n\nA target network association must be created before you can specify a route. If you're setting up all the components of a Client VPN endpoint at the same time, you must use the [DependsOn Attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-dependson.html) to declare a dependency on the `AWS::EC2::ClientVpnTargetNetworkAssociation` resource.",
