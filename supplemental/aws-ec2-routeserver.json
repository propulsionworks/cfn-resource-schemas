  "description": "Specifies a route server to manage dynamic routing in a VPC.\n\nAmazon VPC Route Server simplifies routing for traffic between workloads that are deployed within a VPC and its internet gateways. With this feature, VPC Route Server dynamically updates VPC and internet gateway route tables with your preferred routes to achieve routing fault tolerance for those workloads. This enables you to automatically reroute traffic within a VPC, which increases the manageability of VPC routing and interoperability with third-party workloads.\n\nFor more information see [Dynamic routing in your VPC with VPC Route Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/dynamic-routing-route-server.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide* .",
