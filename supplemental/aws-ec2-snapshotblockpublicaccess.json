Instead, it prevents these snapshots from be publicly visible and publicly accessible. Therefore, the attributes for these snapshots still indicate that they are publicly shared, even though they are not publicly available.\n- `block-new-sharing` - Prevents only new public sharing of snapshots in the Region. Users in the account will no longer be able to request new public sharing. However, snapshots that are already publicly shared, remain publicly available.",
