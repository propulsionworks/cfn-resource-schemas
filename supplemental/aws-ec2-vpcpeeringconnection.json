The accepter VPC can belong to a different AWS account and can be in a different Region than the requester VPC.\n\nThe requester VPC and accepter VPC cannot have overlapping CIDR blocks. If you create a VPC peering connection request between VPCs with overlapping CIDR blocks, the VPC peering connection has a status of `failed` .\n\nIf the VPCs belong to different accounts, the acceptor account must have a role that allows the requester account to accept the VPC peering connection. For an example, see [Walkthrough: Peer with a VPC in another AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/peer-with-vpc-in-another-account.html) .\n\nIf the requester and acceptor VPCs are in the same account, the peering request is accepted without a peering role.",
