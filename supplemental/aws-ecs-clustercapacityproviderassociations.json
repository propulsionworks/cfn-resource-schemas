The `weight` value is taken into consideration after the `base` value, if defined, is satisfied.\n\nIf no `weight` value is specified, the default value of `0` is used. When multiple capacity providers are specified within a capacity provider strategy, at least one of the capacity providers must have a weight value greater than zero and any capacity providers with a weight of `0` can't be used to place tasks. If you specify multiple capacity providers in a strategy that all have a weight of `0` , any `RunTask` or `CreateService` actions using the capacity provider strategy will fail.\n\nAn example scenario for using weights is defining a strategy that contains two capacity providers and both have a weight of `1` , then when the `base` is satisfied, the tasks will be split evenly across the two capacity providers. Using that same logic, if you specify a weight of `1` for *capacityProviderA* and a weight of `4` for *capacityProviderB* , then for every one task that's run using *capacityProviderA* , four tasks would use *capacityProviderB* .",
