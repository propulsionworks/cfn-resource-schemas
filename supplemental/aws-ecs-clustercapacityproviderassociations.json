When multiple capacity providers are specified within a capacity provider strategy, at least one of the capacity providers must have a weight value greater than zero and any capacity providers with a weight of `0` can't be used to place tasks. If you specify multiple capacity providers in a strategy that all have a weight of `0` , any `RunTask` or `CreateService` actions using the capacity provider strategy will fail.\n\nWeight value characteristics:\n\n- Weight is considered after the base value is satisfied\n- Default value is `0` if not specified\n- Valid range: 0 to 1,000\n- At least one capacity provider must have a weight greater than zero\n- Capacity providers with weight of `0` cannot place tasks\n\nTask distribution logic:\n\n- Base satisfaction: The minimum number of tasks specified by the base value are placed on that capacity provider\n- Weight distribution: After base requirements are met, additional tasks are distributed according to weight ratios\n\nExamples:\n\nEqual Distribution: Two capacity providers both with weight `1` will split tasks evenly after base requirements are met.\n\nWeighted Distribution: If capacityProviderA has weight `1` and capacityProviderB has weight `4` , then for every 1 task on A, 4 tasks will run on B.",
