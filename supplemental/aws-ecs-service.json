This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service is using the `REPLICA` service scheduler and has a `desiredCount` of four tasks and a `maximumPercent` value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default `maximumPercent` value for a service using the `REPLICA` service scheduler is 200%.\n\nThe Amazon ECS scheduler uses this parameter to replace unhealthy tasks by starting replacement tasks first and then stopping the unhealthy tasks, as long as cluster resources for starting replacement tasks are available.

This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a `desiredCount` of four tasks and a `minimumHealthyPercent` of 50%, the service scheduler may stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks.\n\nIf any tasks are unhealthy and if `maximumPercent` doesn't allow the Amazon ECS scheduler to start replacement tasks, the scheduler stops the unhealthy tasks one-by-one — using the `minimumHealthyPercent` as a constraint — to clear up capacity to launch replacement tasks. For more information about how the scheduler replaces unhealthy tasks, see [Amazon ECS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) .\n\nFor services that *do not* use a load balancer, the following should be noted:\n\n- A service is considered healthy if all essential containers within the tasks in the service pass their health checks.\n- If a task has no essential containers with a health check defined, the service scheduler will wait for 40 seconds after a task reaches a `RUNNING` state before the task is counted towards the minimum healthy percent total.\n- If a task has one or more essential containers with a health check defined, the service scheduler will wait for the task to reach a healthy status before counting it towards the minimum healthy percent total. A task is considered healthy when all essential containers within the task have passed their health checks. The amount of time the service scheduler can wait for is determined by the container health check settings.\n\nFor services that *do* use a load balancer, the following should be noted:\n\n- If a task has no essential containers with a health check defined, the service scheduler will wait for the load balancer target group health check to return a healthy status before counting the task towards the minimum healthy percent total.\n- If a task has an essential container with a health check defined, the service scheduler will wait for both the task to reach a healthy status and the load balancer target group health check to return a healthy status before counting the task towards the minimum healthy percent total.\n\nThe default value for a replica service for `minimumHealthyPercent` is 100%.

Some of the options you can specify when you use the `awslogs` log driver to route logs to Amazon CloudWatch include the following:\n\n- **awslogs-create-group** - Required: No\n\nSpecify whether you want the log group to be created automatically. If this option isn't specified, it defaults to `false` .\n\n> Your IAM policy must include the `logs:CreateLogGroup` permission before you attempt to use `awslogs-create-group` .\n- **awslogs-region** - Required: Yes\n\nSpecify the AWS Region that the `awslogs` log driver is to send your Docker logs to. You can choose to send all of your logs from clusters in different Regions to a single region in CloudWatch Logs. This is so that they're all visible in one location. Otherwise, you can separate them by Region for more granularity. Make sure that the specified log group exists in the Region that you specify with this option.\n- **awslogs-group** - Required: Yes\n\nMake sure to specify a log group that the `awslogs` log driver sends its log streams to.\n- **awslogs-stream-prefix** - Required: Yes, when using Fargate.Optional when using EC2.\n\nUse the `awslogs-stream-prefix` option to associate a log stream with the specified prefix, the container name, and the ID of the Amazon ECS task that the container belongs to. If you specify a prefix with this option, then the log stream takes the format `prefix-name/container-name/ecs-task-id` .\n\nIf you don't specify a prefix with this option, then the log stream is named after the container ID that's assigned by the Docker daemon on the container instance. Because it's difficult to trace logs back to the container that sent them with just the Docker container ID (which is only available on the container instance), we recommend that you specify a prefix with this option.\n\nFor Amazon ECS services, you can use the service name as the prefix. Doing so, you can trace log streams to the service that the container belongs to, the name of the container that sent them, and the ID of the task that the container belongs to.\n\nYou must specify a stream-prefix for your logs to have your logs appear in the Log pane when using the Amazon ECS console.\n- **awslogs-datetime-format** - Required: No\n\nThis option defines a multiline start pattern in Python `strftime` format. A log message consists of a line that matches the pattern and any following lines that don’t match the pattern. The matched line is the delimiter between log messages.\n\nOne example of a use case for using this format is for parsing output such as a stack dump, which might otherwise be logged in multiple entries. The correct pattern allows it to be captured in a single entry.\n\nFor more information, see [awslogs-datetime-format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/awslogs/#awslogs-datetime-format) .\n\nYou cannot configure both the `awslogs-datetime-format` and `awslogs-multiline-pattern` options.\n\n> Multiline logging performs regular expression parsing and matching of all log messages. This might have a negative impact on logging performance.\n- **awslogs-multiline-pattern** - Required: No\n\nThis option defines a multiline start pattern that uses a regular expression. A log message consists of a line that matches the pattern and any following lines that don’t match the pattern. The matched line is the delimiter between log messages.\n\nFor more information, see [awslogs-multiline-pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/awslogs/#awslogs-multiline-pattern) .\n\nThis option is ignored if `awslogs-datetime-format` is also configured.\n\nYou cannot configure both the `awslogs-datetime-format` and `awslogs-multiline-pattern` options.\n\n> Multiline logging performs regular expression parsing and matching of all log messages. This might have a negative impact on logging performance.\n\nThe following options apply to all supported log drivers.\n\n- **mode** - Required: No\n\nValid values: `non-blocking` | `blocking`\n\nThis option defines the delivery mode of log messages from the container to the log driver specified using `logDriver` . The delivery mode you choose affects application availability when the flow of logs from container is interrupted.\n\nIf you use the `blocking` mode and the flow of logs is interrupted, calls from container code to write to the `stdout` and `stderr` streams will block. The logging thread of the application will block as a result. This may cause the application to become unresponsive and lead to container healthcheck failure.\n\nIf you use the `non-blocking` mode, the container's logs are instead stored in an in-memory intermediate buffer configured with the `max-buffer-size` option. This prevents the application from becoming unresponsive when logs cannot be sent. We recommend using this mode if you want to ensure service availability and are okay with some log loss. For more information, see [Preventing log loss with non-blocking mode in the `awslogs` container log driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/containers/preventing-log-loss-with-non-blocking-mode-in-the-awslogs-container-log-driver/) .\n\nYou can set a default `mode` for all containers in a specific AWS Region by using the `defaultLogDriverMode` account setting. If you don't specify the `mode` option or configure the account setting, Amazon ECS will default to the `non-blocking` mode. For more information about the account setting, see [Default log driver mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-account-settings.html#default-log-driver-mode) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .\n\n> On June 25, 2025, Amazon ECS changed the default log driver mode from `blocking` to `non-blocking` to prioritize task availability over logging. To continue using the `blocking` mode after this change, do one of the following:\n> \n> - Set the `mode` option in your container definition's `logConfiguration` as `blocking` .\n> - Set the `defaultLogDriverMode` account setting to `blocking` .\n- **max-buffer-size** - Required: No\n\nDefault value: `1m`\n\nWhen `non-blocking` mode is used, the `max-buffer-size` log option controls the size of the buffer that's used for intermediate message storage. Make sure to specify an adequate buffer size based on your application. When the buffer fills up, further logs cannot be stored. Logs that cannot be stored are lost.\n\nTo route logs using the `splunk` log router, you need to specify a `splunk-token` and a `splunk-url` .\n\nWhen you use the `awsfirelens` log router to route logs to an AWS Service or AWS Partner Network destination for log storage and analytics, you can set the `log-driver-buffer-limit` option to limit the number of events that are buffered in memory, before being sent to the log router container. It can help to resolve potential log loss issue because high throughput might result in memory running out for the buffer inside of Docker.\n\nOther options you can specify when using `awsfirelens` to route logs depend on the destination. When you export logs to Amazon Data Firehose, you can specify the AWS Region with `region` and a name for the log stream with `delivery_stream` .\n\nWhen you export logs to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, you can specify an AWS Region with `region` and a data stream name with `stream` .\n\nWhen you export logs to Amazon OpenSearch Service, you can specify options like `Name` , `Host` (OpenSearch Service endpoint without protocol), `Port` , `Index` , `Type` , `Aws_auth` , `Aws_region` , `Suppress_Type_Name` , and `tls` . For more information, see [Under the hood: FireLens for Amazon ECS Tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/containers/under-the-hood-firelens-for-amazon-ecs-tasks/) .\n\nWhen you export logs to Amazon S3, you can specify the bucket using the `bucket` option. You can also specify `region` , `total_file_size` , `upload_timeout` , and `use_put_object` as options.\n\nThis parameter requires version 1.19 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your container instance and run the following command: `sudo docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}'`",

However, customers who have used Amazon EI at least once during the past 30-day period are considered current customers and will be able to continue using the service. > On June 12, 2025, Amazon ECS launched support for updating capacity provider configuration for Amazon ECS services. With this launch, Amazon ECS also aligned the AWS CloudFormation update behavior for `CapacityProviderStrategy` parameter with the standard practice. For more information, see [Amazon ECS adds support for updating capacity provider configuration for ECS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/05/amazon-ecs-capacity-provider-configuration-ecs/) . Previously Amazon ECS ignored the `CapacityProviderStrategy` property if it was set to an empty list for example, `[]` in AWS CloudFormation , because updating capacity provider configuration was not supported. Now, with support for capacity provider updates, customers can remove capacity providers from a service by passing an empty list. When you specify an empty list ( `[]` ) for the `CapacityProviderStrategy` property in your AWS CloudFormation template, Amazon ECS will remove any capacity providers associated with the service, as follows:\n> \n> - For services created with a capacity provider strategy after the launch:\n> \n> - If there's a cluster default strategy set, the service will revert to using that default strategy.\n> - If no cluster default strategy exists, you will receive the following error:\n> \n> No launch type to fall back to for empty capacity provider strategy. Your service was not created with a launch type.\n> - For services created with a capacity provider strategy prior to the launch:\n> \n> - If `CapacityProviderStrategy` had `FARGATE_SPOT` or `FARGATE` capacity providers, the launch type will be updated to `FARGATE` and the capacity provider will be removed.\n> - If the strategy included Auto Scaling group capacity providers, the service will revert to EC2 launch type, and the Auto Scaling group capacity providers will not be used.\n> \n> Recommended Actions\n> \n> If you are currently using `CapacityProviderStrategy: []` in your AWS CloudFormation templates, you should take one of the following actions:\n> \n> - If you do not intend to update the Capacity Provider Strategy:\n> \n> - Remove the `CapacityProviderStrategy` property entirely from your AWS CloudFormation template\n> - Alternatively, use `!Ref AWS ::NoValue` for the `CapacityProviderStrategy` property in your template\n> - If you intend to maintain or update the Capacity Provider Strategy, specify the actual Capacity Provider Strategy for the service in your AWS CloudFormation template.\n> \n> If your AWS CloudFormation template had an empty list ([]) for `CapacityProviderStrategy` prior to the aforementioned launch on June 12, and you are using the same template with `CapacityProviderStrategy: []` , you might encounter the following error:\n> \n> Invalid request provided: When switching from launch type to capacity provider strategy on an existing service, or making a change to a capacity provider strategy on a service that is already using one, you must force a new deployment.

This scheduler strategy is required if the service uses the `CODE_DEPLOY` or `EXTERNAL` deployment controller types.\n- `DAEMON` -The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster.

When you're using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies.\n\n> Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the `CODE_DEPLOY` or `EXTERNAL` deployment controller types don't support the `DAEMON` scheduling strategy.",
