  "description": "Creates an Amazon EKS control plane.\n\nThe Amazon EKS control plane consists of control plane instances that run the Kubernetes software, such as `etcd` and the API server. The control plane runs in an account managed by AWS , and the Kubernetes API is exposed by the Amazon EKS API server endpoint. Each Amazon EKS cluster control plane is single tenant and unique. It runs on its own set of Amazon EC2 instances.\n\nThe cluster control plane is provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide connectivity from the control plane instances to the nodes (for example, to support `kubectl exec` , `logs` , and `proxy` data flows).\n\nAmazon EKS nodes run in your AWS account and connect to your cluster's control plane over the Kubernetes API server endpoint and a certificate file that is created for your cluster.\n\nYou can use the `endpointPublicAccess` and `endpointPrivateAccess` parameters to enable or disable public and private access to your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint. By default, public access is enabled, and private access is disabled. For more information, see [Amazon EKS Cluster Endpoint Access Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-endpoint.html) in the **Amazon EKS User Guide** .\n\nYou can use the `logging` parameter to enable or disable exporting the Kubernetes control plane logs for your cluster to CloudWatch Logs. By default, cluster control plane logs aren't exported to CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see [Amazon EKS Cluster Control Plane Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html) in the **Amazon EKS User Guide** .\n\n> CloudWatch Logs ingestion, archive storage, and data scanning rates apply to exported control plane logs. For more information, see [CloudWatch Pricing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) . \n\nIn most cases, it takes several minutes to create a cluster. After you create an Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure your Kubernetes tooling to communicate with the API server and launch nodes into your cluster.
