If you use this resource, CloudFormation waits for the cluster launch to complete before adding the task instance fleet to the cluster. In order to add a task instance fleet to the cluster as part of the cluster launch and minimize delays in provisioning task nodes, use the `TaskInstanceFleets` subproperty for the [AWS::EMR::Cluster JobFlowInstancesConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-elasticmapreduce-cluster-jobflowinstancesconfig.html) property instead. To use this subproperty, see [AWS::EMR::Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-elasticmapreduce-cluster.html) for examples.",
