Or, if all the accounts are members of the same AWS organization, you can run `PutPermission` once specifying `Principal` as \"*\" and specifying the AWS organization ID in `Condition` , to grant permissions to all accounts in that organization.\n\nIf you grant permissions using an organization, then accounts in that organization must specify a `RoleArn` with proper permissions when they use `PutTarget` to add your account's event bus as a target.
