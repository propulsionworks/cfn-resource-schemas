Amazon EventBridge rules in your account are triggered by these events arriving to an event bus in your account.\n\nFor another account to send events to your account, that external account must have an EventBridge rule with your account's event bus as a target.\n\nTo enable multiple AWS accounts to put events to your event bus, run `PutPermission` once for each of these accounts. Or, if all the accounts are members of the same AWS organization, you can run `PutPermission` once specifying `Principal` as \"*\" and specifying the AWS organization ID in `Condition` , to grant permissions to all accounts in that organization.\n\nIf you grant permissions using an organization, then accounts in that organization must specify a `RoleArn` with proper permissions when they use `PutTarget` to add your account's event bus as a target. For more information, see [Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-cross-account-event-delivery.html) in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide* .\n\nThe permission policy on the event bus cannot exceed 10 KB in size.",
