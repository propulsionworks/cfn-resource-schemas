  "description": "Creates an Amazon Forecast dataset.\n\n> Amazon Forecast is no longer available to new customers. Existing customers of Amazon Forecast can continue to use the service as normal. [Learn more\"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/transition-your-amazon-forecast-usage-to-amazon-sagemaker-canvas/) \n\nThe information about the dataset that you provide helps Forecast understand how to consume the data for model training. This includes the following:\n\n- *`DataFrequency`* - How frequently your historical time-series data is collected.\n- *`Domain`* and *`DatasetType`* - Each dataset has an associated dataset domain and a type within the domain. Amazon Forecast provides a list of predefined domains and types within each domain. For each unique dataset domain and type within the domain, Amazon Forecast requires your data to include a minimum set of predefined fields.\n- *`Schema`* - A schema specifies the fields in the dataset, including the field name and data type.\n\nAfter creating a dataset, you import your training data into it and add the dataset to a dataset group. You use the dataset group to create a predictor. For more information, see [Importing datasets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/howitworks-datasets-groups.html) .\n\nTo get a list of all your datasets, use the [ListDatasets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_ListDatasets.html) operation.\n\nFor example Forecast datasets, see the [Amazon Forecast Sample GitHub repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-forecast-samples) .\n\n> The `Status` of a dataset must be `ACTIVE` before you can import training data. Use the [DescribeDataset](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_DescribeDataset.html) operation to get the status.",

For example, \"1D\" indicates every day and \"15min\" indicates every 15 minutes. You cannot specify a value that would overlap with the next larger frequency. That means, for example, you cannot specify a frequency of 60 minutes, because that is equivalent to 1 hour. The valid values for each frequency are the following:\n\n- Minute - 1-59\n- Hour - 1-23\n- Day - 1-6\n- Week - 1-4\n- Month - 1-11\n- Year - 1\n\nThus, if you want every other week forecasts, specify \"2W\".
