You can view the status of your game server groups in the GameLift console. Game server group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch.\n\nBefore creating a new game server group, you must have the following:\n\n- An Amazon EC2 launch template that specifies how to launch Amazon EC2 instances with your game server build.

You must also set initial maximum and minimum limits on the group's instance count. You can optionally set an Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based on a GameLift FleetIQ metric.\n\nOnce the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you have full access to change the Auto Scaling group's configuration as needed. Several properties that are set when creating a game server group, including maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group.
