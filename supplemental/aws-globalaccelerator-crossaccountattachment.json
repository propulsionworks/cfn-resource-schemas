  "description": "Create a cross-account attachment in AWS Global Accelerator . You create a cross-account attachment to specify the *principals* who have permission to work with *resources* in accelerators in their own account. You specify, in the same attachment, the resources that are shared.\n\nA principal can be an AWS account number or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an accelerator. For account numbers that are listed as principals, to work with a resource listed in the attachment, you must sign in to an account specified as a principal. Then, you can work with resources that are listed, with any of your accelerators. If an accelerator ARN is listed in the cross-account attachment as a principal, anyone with permission to make updates to the accelerator can work with resources that are listed in the attachment.\n\nSpecify each principal and resource separately. To specify two CIDR address pools, list them individually under `Resources` , and so on. For a command line operation, for example, you might use a statement like the following:\n\n`\"Resources\": [{\"Cidr\": \"169.254.60.0/24\"},{\"Cidr\": \"169.254.59.0/24\"}]`\n\nFor more information, see [Working with cross-account attachments and resources in AWS Global Accelerator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/cross-account-resources.html) in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* .",
