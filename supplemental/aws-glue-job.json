We recommend this worker type for workloads such as data transforms, joins, and queries, to offers a scalable and cost effective way to run most jobs.\n- For the `G.2X` worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8 vCPUs, 32 GB of memory) with 138GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for workloads such as data transforms, joins, and queries, to offers a scalable and cost effective way to run most jobs.\n- For the `G.4X` worker type, each worker maps to 4 DPU (16 vCPUs, 64 GB of memory) with 256GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker.

California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Spain), Europe (Stockholm), and South America (São Paulo).\n- For the `G.8X` worker type, each worker maps to 8 DPU (32 vCPUs, 128 GB of memory) with 512GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for jobs whose workloads contain your most demanding transforms, aggregations, joins, and queries.
