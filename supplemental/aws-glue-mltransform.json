A value of 1.0 means a bias purely for accuracy, which typically results in a higher cost, sometimes substantially higher. A value of 0.0 means a bias purely for cost, which results in a less accurate `FindMatches` transform, sometimes with unacceptable accuracy.\n\nAccuracy measures how well the transform finds true positives and true negatives. Increasing accuracy requires more machine resources and cost. But it also results in increased recall.\n\nCost measures how many compute resources, and thus money, are consumed to run the transform.",
