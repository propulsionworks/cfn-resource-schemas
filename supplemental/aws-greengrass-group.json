  "description": "AWS IoT Greengrass seamlessly extends AWS to edge devices so they can act locally on the data they generate, while still using the cloud for management, analytics, and durable storage. With AWS IoT Greengrass , connected devices can run AWS Lambda functions, execute predictions based on machine learning models, keep device data in sync, and communicate with other devices securely â€“ even when not connected to the internet. For more information, see the [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v1/developerguide/what-is-gg.html) .\n\n> For AWS Region support, see [AWS CloudFormation Support for AWS IoT Greengrass](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v1/developerguide/cloudformation-support.html) in the *Developer Guide* . \n\nThe `AWS::Greengrass::Group` resource represents a group in AWS IoT Greengrass . In the AWS IoT Greengrass API, groups are used to organize your group versions.\n\nGroups can reference multiple group versions. All group versions must be associated with a group. A group version references a device definition version, subscription definition version, and other version types that contain the components you want to deploy to a Greengrass core device.\n\nTo deploy a group version, the group version must reference a core definition version that contains one core. Other version types are optionally included, depending on your business need.\n\n> When you create a group, you can optionally include an initial group version. To associate a group version later, create a [`AWS::Greengrass::GroupVersion`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-greengrass-groupversion.html) resource and specify the ID of this group.\n> \n> To change group components (such as devices, subscriptions, or functions), you must create new versions. This is because versions are immutable. For example, to add a function, you create a function definition version that contains the new function (and all other functions that you want to deploy). Then you create a group version that references the new function definition version (and all other version types that you want to deploy). \n\n*Deploying a Group Version*\n\nAfter you create the group version in your AWS CloudFormation template, you can deploy it using the [`aws greengrass create-deployment`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v1/apireference/createdeployment-post.html) command in the AWS CLI or from the *Greengrass* node in the AWS IoT console. To deploy a group version, you must have a Greengrass service role associated with your AWS account .
