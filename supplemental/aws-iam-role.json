For more information about IAM roles, go to [Using Roles to Delegate Permissions and Federate Identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html) .\n\nA role can also have an attached managed policy.

This dependency ensures that the role's policy is available throughout the resource's lifecycle. For example, when you delete a stack with an `AWS::ECS::Service` resource, the `DependsOn` attribute ensures that AWS CloudFormation deletes the `AWS::ECS::Service` resource before deleting its role's policy.",

You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-. The role name must be unique within the account. Role names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create roles named both \"Role1\" and \"role1\".\n\nIf you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the role name.\n\nIf you specify a name, you must specify the `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` value to acknowledge your template's capabilities.
