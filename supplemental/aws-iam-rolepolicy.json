  "description": "Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM role.\n\nWhen you embed an inline policy in a role, the inline policy is used as part of the role's access (permissions) policy. The role's trust policy is created at the same time as the role, using [`CreateRole`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreateRole.html) . You can update a role's trust policy using [`UpdateAssumeRolePolicy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAssumeRolePolicy.html) . For information about roles, see [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html) in the *IAM User Guide* .\n\nA role can also have a managed policy attached to it. To attach a managed policy to a role, use [`AWS::IAM::Role`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-role.html) . To create a new managed policy, use [`AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-managedpolicy.html) . For information about policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the *IAM User Guide* .\n\nFor information about the maximum number of inline policies that you can embed with a role, see [IAM and AWS STS quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html) in the *IAM User Guide* .",
