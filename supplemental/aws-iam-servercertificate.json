  "description": "Uploads a server certificate entity for the AWS account . The server certificate entity includes a public key certificate, a private key, and an optional certificate chain, which should all be PEM-encoded.\n\nWe recommend that you use [AWS Certificate Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/) to provision, manage, and deploy your server certificates. With ACM you can request a certificate, deploy it to AWS resources, and let ACM handle certificate renewals for you. Certificates provided by ACM are free. For more information about using ACM, see the [AWS Certificate Manager User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/) .\n\nFor more information about working with server certificates, see [Working with server certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html) in the *IAM User Guide* . This topic includes a list of AWS services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.\n\nFor information about the number of server certificates you can upload, see [IAM and AWS STS quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html) in the *IAM User Guide* .\n\n> Because the body of the public key certificate, private key, and the certificate chain can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling `UploadServerCertificate` .
