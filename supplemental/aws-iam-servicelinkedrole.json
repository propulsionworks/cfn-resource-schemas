  "description": "Creates an IAM role that is linked to a specific AWS service. The service controls the attached policies and when the role can be deleted. This helps ensure that the service is not broken by an unexpectedly changed or deleted role, which could put your AWS resources into an unknown state. Allowing the service to control the role helps improve service stability and proper cleanup when a service and its role are no longer needed. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the *IAM User Guide* .\n\nTo attach a policy to this service-linked role, you must make the request using the AWS service that depends on this role.",

For example, you could add `-1` or `-debug` to the suffix.\n\nSome services do not support the `CustomSuffix` parameter.
