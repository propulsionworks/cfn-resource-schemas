You can change the logging settings by either:\n> \n> - Importing the existing logging resource into your AWS CloudFormation stack, such as with the [infrastructure as code generator (IaC generator)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/generate-IaC.html) .\n> - Calling `aws iot set-v2-logging-options --disable-all-logs` before creating a new CloudFormation stack. This command disables all AWS IoT logging. As a result, no AWS IoT logs will be delivered to Amazon CloudWatch until you re-enable logging.",
