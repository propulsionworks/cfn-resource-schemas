      "description": "Enables or updates server-side encryption using an AWS KMS key for a specified stream.\n\n> When invoking this API, you must use either the `StreamARN` or the `StreamName` parameter, or both. It is recommended that you use the `StreamARN` input parameter when you invoke this API. \n\nStarting encryption is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the request, Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to `UPDATING` . After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the status of the stream back to `ACTIVE` . Updating or applying encryption normally takes a few seconds to complete, but it can take minutes. You can continue to read and write data to your stream while its status is `UPDATING` . Once the status of the stream is `ACTIVE` , encryption begins for records written to the stream.\n\nAPI Limits: You can successfully apply a new AWS KMS key for server-side encryption 25 times in a rolling 24-hour period.\n\nNote: It can take up to 5 seconds after the stream is in an `ACTIVE` status before all records written to the stream are encrypted. After you enable encryption, you can verify that encryption is applied by inspecting the API response from `PutRecord` or `PutRecords` .",
