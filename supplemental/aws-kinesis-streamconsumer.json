  "description": "Use the AWS CloudFormation `AWS::Kinesis::StreamConsumer` resource to register a consumer with a Kinesis data stream. The consumer you register can then call [SubscribeToShard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_SubscribeToShard.html) to receive data from the stream using enhanced fan-out, at a rate of up to 2 MiB per second for every shard you subscribe to. This rate is unaffected by the total number of consumers that read from the same stream.\n\nYou can register up to 20 consumers per stream. However, you can request a limit increase using the [Kinesis Data Streams limits form](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/support/v1?#/) . A given consumer can only be registered with one stream at a time.\n\nFor more information, see [Using Consumers with Enhanced Fan-Out](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/introduction-to-enhanced-consumers.html) .",
