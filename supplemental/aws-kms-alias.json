  "description": "The `AWS::KMS::Alias` resource specifies a display name for a [KMS key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#kms_keys) . You can use an alias to identify a KMS key in the AWS  console, in the [DescribeKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html) operation, and in [cryptographic operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations) , such as [Decrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Decrypt.html) and [GenerateDataKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKey.html) .\n\n> Adding, deleting, or updating an alias can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For details, see [ABAC for AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/abac.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* . \n\nUsing an alias to refer to a KMS key can help you simplify key management. For example, an alias in your code can be associated with different KMS keys in different AWS Regions . For more information, see [Using aliases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-alias.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .\n\nWhen specifying an alias, observe the following rules.\n\n- Each alias is associated with one KMS key, but multiple aliases can be associated with the same KMS key.\n- The alias and its associated KMS key must be in the same AWS account and Region.\n- The alias name must be unique in the AWS account and Region. However, you can create aliases with the same name in different AWS Regions . For example, you can have an `alias/projectKey` in multiple Regions, each of which is associated with a KMS key in its Region.\n- Each alias name must begin with `alias/` followed by a name, such as `alias/exampleKey` . The alias name can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). Alias names cannot begin with `alias/aws/` . That alias name prefix is reserved for [AWS managed keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk) .\n\n*Regions*\n\nAWS  CloudFormation resources are available in all AWS Regions in which AWS  and CloudFormation are supported.",

This value must begin with `alias/` followed by a name, such as `alias/ExampleAlias` .\n\n> If you change the value of the `AliasName` property, the existing alias is deleted and a new alias is created for the specified KMS key. This change can disrupt applications that use the alias. It can also allow or deny access to a KMS key affected by attribute-based access control (ABAC). \n\nThe alias must be string of 1-256 characters. It can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). The alias name cannot begin with `alias/aws/` .
