You can use this resource to create symmetric encryption KMS keys, asymmetric KMS keys for encryption or signing, and symmetric HMAC KMS keys. You can use `AWS::KMS::Key` to create [multi-Region primary keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html#mrk-primary-key) of all supported types. To replicate a multi-Region key, use the `AWS::KMS::ReplicaKey` resource.\n\n> If you change the value of the `KeySpec` , `KeyUsage` , `Origin` , or `MultiRegion` properties of an existing KMS key, the update request fails, regardless of the value of the [`UpdateReplacePolicy` attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatereplacepolicy.html) . This prevents you from accidentally deleting a KMS key by changing any of its immutable property values. > AWS KMS replaced the term *customer master key (CMK)* with *AWS KMS key* and *KMS key* . The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, AWS KMS is keeping some variations of this term. \n\nYou can use symmetric encryption KMS keys to encrypt and decrypt small amounts of data, but they are more commonly used to generate data keys and data key pairs. You can also use a symmetric encryption KMS key to encrypt data stored in AWS services that are [integrated with AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//kms/features/#AWS_Service_Integration) .

For details, see [Asymmetric keys in AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .\n\nYou can use HMAC KMS keys (which are also symmetric keys) to generate and verify hash-based message authentication codes. To create an HMAC key, you must specify an HMAC `KeySpec` value and a `KeyUsage` value of `GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC` . For details, see [HMAC keys in AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/hmac.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .\n\nYou can also create symmetric encryption, asymmetric, and HMAC multi-Region primary keys.
