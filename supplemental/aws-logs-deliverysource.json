  "description": "Creates or updates one *delivery source* in your account. A delivery source is an AWS resource that sends logs to an AWS destination. The destination can be CloudWatch Logs , Amazon S3 , or Firehose .\n\nOnly some AWS services support being configured as a delivery source. These services are listed as *Supported [V2 Permissions]* in the table at [Enabling logging from AWS services.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AWS-logs-and-resource-policy.html)\n\nTo configure logs delivery between a supported AWS service and a destination, you must do the following:\n\n- Create a delivery source, which is a logical object that represents the resource that is actually sending the logs.\n- Create a *delivery destination* , which is a logical object that represents the actual delivery destination. For more information, see [AWS::Logs::DeliveryDestination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-logs-deliverydestination.html) or [PutDeliveryDestination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliveryDestination.html) .\n- Create a *delivery* by pairing exactly one delivery source and one delivery destination. For more information, see [AWS::Logs::Delivery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-logs-delivery.html) or [CreateDelivery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDelivery.html) .\n\nYou can configure a single delivery source to send logs to multiple destinations by creating multiple deliveries. You can also create multiple deliveries to configure multiple delivery sources to send logs to the same delivery destination.",
