  "description": "Creates or updates an *anomaly detector* that regularly scans one or more log groups and look for patterns and anomalies in the logs.\n\nAn anomaly detector can help surface issues by automatically discovering anomalies in your log event traffic. An anomaly detector uses machine learning algorithms to scan log events and find *patterns* . A pattern is a shared text structure that recurs among your log fields. Patterns provide a useful tool for analyzing large sets of logs because a large number of log events can often be compressed into a few patterns.\n\nThe anomaly detector uses pattern recognition to find `anomalies` , which are unusual log events. It compares current log events and patterns with trained baselines.\n\nFields within a pattern are called *tokens* . Fields that vary within a pattern, such as a request ID or timestamp, are referred to as *dynamic tokens* and represented by `<*>` .\n\nFor more information see [Log anomaly detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/LogsAnomalyDetection.html) .",
