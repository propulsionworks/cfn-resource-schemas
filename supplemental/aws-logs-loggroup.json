  "description": "The `AWS::Logs::LogGroup` resource specifies a log group. A log group defines common properties for log streams, such as their retention and access control rules. Each log stream must belong to one log group.\n\nYou can create up to 1,000,000 log groups per Region per account. You must use the following guidelines when naming a log group:\n\n- Log group names must be unique within a Region for an AWS account.\n- Log group names can be between 1 and 512 characters long.\n- Log group names consist of the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_' (underscore), '-' (hyphen), '/' (forward slash), and '.' (period).",

Creating field indexes lowers the costs for CloudWatch Logs Insights queries that reference those field indexes, because these queries attempt to skip the processing of log events that are known to not match the indexed field. Good fields to index are fields that you often need to query for and fields that have high cardinality of values Common examples of indexes include request ID, session ID, userID, and instance IDs. For more information, see [Create field indexes to improve query performance and reduce costs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatchLogs-Field-Indexing.html) .\n\nCurrently, this array supports only one field index policy object.",
