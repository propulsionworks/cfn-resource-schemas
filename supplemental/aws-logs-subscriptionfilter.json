Subscription filters allow you to subscribe to a real-time stream of log events and have them delivered to a specific destination. Currently, the supported destinations are:\n\n- An Amazon Kinesis data stream belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.\n- A logical destination that belongs to a different account, for cross-account delivery.\n- An Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.\n- An AWS Lambda function that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.\n\nThere can be as many as two subscription filters associated with a log group.",
