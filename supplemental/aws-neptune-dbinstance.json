  "description": "The `AWS::Neptune::DBInstance` type creates an Amazon Neptune DB instance.\n\n*Updating DB Instances*\n\nYou can set a deletion policy for your DB instance to control how AWS CloudFormation handles the instance when the stack is deleted. For Neptune DB instances, you can choose to *retain* the instance, to *delete* the instance, or to *create a snapshot* of the instance. The default AWS CloudFormation behavior depends on the `DBClusterIdentifier` property:\n\n- For `AWS::Neptune::DBInstance` resources that don't specify the `DBClusterIdentifier` property, AWS CloudFormation saves a snapshot of the DB instance.\n- For `AWS::Neptune::DBInstance` resources that do specify the `DBClusterIdentifier` property, AWS CloudFormation deletes the DB instance.\n\n*Deleting DB Instances*\n\n> If a DB instance is deleted or replaced during an update, AWS CloudFormation deletes all automated snapshots. However, it retains manual DB snapshots. During an update that requires replacement, you can apply a stack policy to prevent DB instances from being replaced. \n\nWhen properties labeled *Update requires: Replacement* are updated, AWS CloudFormation first creates a replacement DB instance, changes references from other dependent resources to point to the replacement DB instance, and finally deletes the old DB instance.\n\n> We highly recommend that you take a snapshot of the database before updating the stack. If you don't, you lose the data when AWS CloudFormation replaces your DB instance. To preserve your data, perform the following procedure:\n> \n> - Deactivate any applications that are using the DB instance so that there's no activity on the DB instance.\n> - Create a snapshot of the DB instance.\n> - If you want to restore your instance using a DB snapshot, modify the updated template with your DB instance changes and add the `DBSnapshotIdentifier` property with the ID of the DB snapshot that you want to use.\n> - Update the stack.",
