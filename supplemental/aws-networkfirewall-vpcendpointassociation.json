  "description": "A VPC endpoint association defines a single subnet to use for a firewall endpoint for a `Firewall` . You can define VPC endpoint associations only in the Availability Zones that already have a subnet mapping defined in the `Firewall` resource.\n\n> You can retrieve the list of Availability Zones that are available for use by calling `DescribeFirewallMetadata` . \n\nTo manage firewall endpoints, first, in the `Firewall` specification, you specify a single VPC and one subnet for each of the Availability Zones where you want to use the firewall. Then you can define additional endpoints as VPC endpoint associations.\n\nYou can use VPC endpoint associations to expand the protections of the firewall as follows:\n\n- *Protect multiple VPCs with a single firewall* - You can use the firewall to protect other VPCs, either in your account or in accounts where the firewall is shared. You can only specify Availability Zones that already have a firewall endpoint defined in the `Firewall` subnet mappings.\n- *Define multiple firewall endpoints for a VPC in an Availability Zone* - You can create additional firewall endpoints for the VPC that you have defined in the firewall, in any Availability Zone that already has an endpoint defined in the `Firewall` subnet mappings. You can create multiple VPC endpoint associations for any other VPC where you use the firewall.\n\nYou can use AWS Resource Access Manager to share a `Firewall` that you own with other accounts, which gives them the ability to use the firewall to create VPC endpoint associations. For information about sharing a firewall, see `PutResourcePolicy` in this guide and see [Sharing Network Firewall resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/sharing.html) in the *AWS Network Firewall Developer Guide* .\n\nThe status of the VPC endpoint association, which indicates whether it's ready to filter network traffic, is provided in the corresponding `VpcEndpointAssociationStatus` . You can retrieve both the association and its status by calling `DescribeVpcEndpointAssociation` .",
