If you created any policies inside of the organization, they're also deleted and you can't recover them.\n> - You can delete an organization only after you remove all member accounts from the organization. If you created some of your member accounts using AWS Organizations , you might be blocked from removing those accounts. You can remove a member account only if it has all the information that's required to operate as a standalone AWS account.

This can take up to 90 days and can prevent you from deleting the organization until all member accounts are completely closed.\n> \n> For more information, see [Deleting an organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_delete.html) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide* .",
