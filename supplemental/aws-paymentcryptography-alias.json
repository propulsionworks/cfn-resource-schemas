  "description": "Creates an *alias* , or a friendly name, for an AWS Payment Cryptography key. You can use an alias to identify a key in the console and when you call cryptographic operations such as [EncryptData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/DataAPIReference/API_EncryptData.html) or [DecryptData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/DataAPIReference/API_DecryptData.html) .\n\nYou can associate the alias with any key in the same AWS Region . Each alias is associated with only one key at a time, but a key can have multiple aliases. You can't create an alias without a key. The alias must be unique in the account and AWS Region , but you can create another alias with the same name in a different AWS Region .\n\nTo change the key that's associated with the alias, call [UpdateAlias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAlias.html) . To delete the alias, call [DeleteAlias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteAlias.html) . These operations don't affect the underlying key. To get the alias that you created, call [ListAliases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_ListAliases.html) .\n\n*Cross-account use* : This operation can't be used across different AWS accounts.\n\n*Related operations:*\n\n- [DeleteAlias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteAlias.html)\n- [GetAlias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_GetAlias.html)\n- [ListAliases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_ListAliases.html)\n- [UpdateAlias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAlias.html)",
