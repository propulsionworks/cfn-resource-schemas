  "description": "Specifies an identity to use for sending email through Amazon Pinpoint. In Amazon Pinpoint, an *identity* is an email address or domain that you use when you send email. Before you can use Amazon Pinpoint to send an email from an identity, you first have to verify it. By verifying an identity, you demonstrate that you're the owner of the address or domain, and that you've given Amazon Pinpoint permission to send email from that identity.\n\nWhen you verify an email address, Amazon Pinpoint sends an email to the address. Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the verification email.\n\nWhen you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens, which you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon Pinpoint detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. It usually takes around 72 hours to complete the domain verification process.\n\n> When you use CloudFormation to specify an identity, CloudFormation might indicate that the identity was created successfully. However, you have to verify the identity before you can use it to send email.",
