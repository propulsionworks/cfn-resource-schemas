If you don't, you lose the data when AWS CloudFormation replaces your DB cluster. To preserve your data, perform the following procedure:\n> \n> - Deactivate any applications that are using the DB cluster so that there's no activity on the DB instance.\n> - Create a snapshot of the DB cluster. For more information, see [Creating a DB cluster snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_CreateSnapshotCluster.html) .\n> - If you want to restore your DB cluster using a DB cluster snapshot, modify the updated template with your DB cluster changes and add the `SnapshotIdentifier` property with the ID of the DB cluster snapshot that you want to use.\n> \n> After you restore a DB cluster with a `SnapshotIdentifier` property, you must specify the same `SnapshotIdentifier` property for any future updates to the DB cluster. When you specify this property for an update, the DB cluster is not restored from the DB cluster snapshot again, and the data in the database is not changed. However, if you don't specify the `SnapshotIdentifier` property, an empty DB cluster is created, and the original DB cluster is deleted. If you specify a property that is different from the previous snapshot restore property, a new DB cluster is restored from the specified `SnapshotIdentifier` property, and the original DB cluster is deleted.\n> - Update the stack. \n\nCurrently, when you are updating the stack for an Aurora Serverless DB cluster, you can't include changes to any other properties when you specify one of the following properties: `PreferredBackupWindow` , `PreferredMaintenanceWindow` , and `Port` .

That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.\n\nWhen the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.\n\nValid for Cluster Type: Multi-AZ DB clusters only\n\nDefault: The default behavior varies depending on whether `DBSubnetGroupName` is specified.\n\nIf `DBSubnetGroupName` isn't specified, and `PubliclyAccessible` isn't specified, the following applies:\n\n- If the default VPC in the target Region doesn’t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.\n- If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public.\n\nIf `DBSubnetGroupName` is specified, and `PubliclyAccessible` isn't specified, the following applies:\n\n- If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn’t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.\n- If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public.",
