          "description": "*Alias records only:* The value that you specify depends on where you want to route queries:\n\n- **Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs** - Specify the applicable domain name for your API. You can get the applicable value using the AWS CLI command [get-domain-names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-domain-names.html) :\n\n- For regional APIs, specify the value of `regionalDomainName` .\n- For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of `distributionDomainName` . This is the name of the associated CloudFront distribution, such as `da1b2c3d4e5.cloudfront.net` .\n\n> The name of the record that you're creating must match a custom domain name for your API, such as `api.example.com` .\n- **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint** - Enter the API endpoint for the interface endpoint, such as `vpce-123456789abcdef01-example-us-east-1a.elasticloadbalancing.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com` . For edge-optimized APIs, this is the domain name for the corresponding CloudFront distribution. You can get the value of `DnsName` using the AWS CLI command [describe-vpc-endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html) .\n- **CloudFront distribution** - Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution.\n\nYour CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of the record. For example, if the name of the record is *acme.example.com* , your CloudFront distribution must include *acme.example.com* as one of the alternate domain names. For more information, see [Using Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .\n\nYou can't create a record in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a CloudFront distribution.\n\n> For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the primary and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have the same name, and you can't include the same alternate domain name in more than one distribution.\n- **Elastic Beanstalk environment** - If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes the region that you deployed the environment in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the environment. For example, the domain name `my-environment. *us-west-2* .elasticbeanstalk.com` is a regionalized domain name.\n\n> For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include the region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of an alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain name. For example, if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record that routes traffic for acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record that routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment. \n\nFor Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the `CNAME` attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the value of the CNAME attribute:\n\n- *AWS Management Console* : For information about how to get the value by using the console, see [Using Custom Domains with AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html) in the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide* .\n- *Elastic Beanstalk API* : Use the `DescribeEnvironments` action to get the value of the `CNAME` attribute. For more information, see [DescribeEnvironments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/API_DescribeEnvironments.html) in the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk API Reference* .\n- *AWS CLI* : Use the `describe-environments` command to get the value of the `CNAME` attribute. For more information, see [describe-environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticbeanstalk/describe-environments.html) in the *AWS CLI* .\n- **ELB load balancer** - Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get the DNS name by using the AWS Management Console , the ELB API, or the AWS CLI .\n\n- *AWS Management Console* : Go to the EC2 page, choose *Load Balancers* in the navigation pane, choose the load balancer, choose the *Description* tab, and get the value of the *DNS name* field.\n\nIf you're routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer, get the value that begins with *dualstack* . If you're routing traffic to another type of load balancer, get the value that applies to the record type, A or AAAA.\n- *Elastic Load Balancing API* : Use `DescribeLoadBalancers` to get the value of `DNSName` . For more information, see the applicable guide:\n\n- Classic Load Balancers: [DescribeLoadBalancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/2012-06-01/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html)\n- Application and Network Load Balancers: [DescribeLoadBalancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html)\n- *CloudFormation Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function* : Use the [Fn::GetAtt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-getatt.html) intrinsic function to get the value of `DNSName` :\n\n- [Classic Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-elb.html#aws-properties-ec2-elb-return-values) .\n- [Application and Network Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-elasticloadbalancingv2-loadbalancer.html#aws-resource-elasticloadbalancingv2-loadbalancer-return-values) .\n- *AWS CLI* : Use `describe-load-balancers` to get the value of `DNSName` . For more information, see the applicable guide:\n\n- Classic Load Balancers: [describe-load-balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elb/describe-load-balancers.html)\n- Application and Network Load Balancers: [describe-load-balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elbv2/describe-load-balancers.html)\n- **Global Accelerator accelerator** - Specify the DNS name for your accelerator:\n\n- *Global Accelerator API* : To get the DNS name, use [DescribeAccelerator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/API_DescribeAccelerator.html) .\n- *AWS CLI* : To get the DNS name, use [describe-accelerator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/globalaccelerator/describe-accelerator.html) .\n- **Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website** - Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint that you created the bucket in, for example, `s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com` . For more information about valid values, see the table [Amazon S3 Website Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html#s3_website_region_endpoints) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* . For more information about using S3 buckets for websites, see [Getting Started with Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.*\n- **Another Route 53 record** - Specify the value of the `Name` element for a record in the current hosted zone.\n\n> If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as the zone apex), you can't specify the domain name for a record for which the value of `Type` is `CNAME` . This is because the alias record must have the same type as the record that you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported even for an alias record.",

(An environment automatically contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other available resources that are healthy, if any.\n\nIf the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.\n- **ELB load balancers** - Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:\n\n- *Classic Load Balancers* : If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in `DNSName` , Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. If you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` and either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other resources.\n- *Application and Network Load Balancers* : If you specify an ELB Application or Network Load Balancer and you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` , Route 53 routes queries to the load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated with the load balancer:\n\n- For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target group that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target group contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes queries to other resources.\n- A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.\n\n> When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load balancer.\n- **S3 buckets** - There are no special requirements for setting `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` when the alias target is an S3 bucket.\n- **Other records in the same hosted zone** - If the AWS resource that you specify in `DNSName` is a record or a group of records (for example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that you associate a health check with all of the records in the alias target.

For example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of `192.0.2.111` , create a resource record set with a `Type` of `A` and a `ContinentCode` of `AF` .\n\nIf you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource.\n\nYou can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic location.\n\nThe value `*` in the `CountryCode` element matches all geographic locations that aren't specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the `Name` and `Type` elements.\n\n> Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of `CountryCode` is `*` . Two groups of queries are routed to the resource that you specify in this record: queries that come from locations for which you haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create a `*` resource record set, Route 53 returns a \"no answer\" response for queries from those locations. \n\nYou can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the `Name` and `Type` elements as geolocation resource record sets.",

When you add a `HealthCheckId` element to a resource record set, Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health check. \n\nFor more information, see the following topics in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* :\n\n- [How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html)\n- [Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html)\n- [Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html)\n\n*When to Specify HealthCheckId*\n\nSpecifying a value for `HealthCheckId` is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the following configurations:\n\n- *Non-alias resource record sets* : You're checking the health of a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for all the resource record sets.\n\nIf the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.\n\nIf the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.\n\nIf the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.\n- *Alias resource record sets* : You specify the following settings:\n\n- You set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for an alias resource record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).\n- You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.\n- You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.\n\nIf the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.\n\nIf the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the alias resource record set.\n\n> The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record sets.\n\n*Geolocation Routing*\n\nFor geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a resource record set that has `*` for `CountryCode` is `*` , which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:\n\n- The United States\n- North America\n- The default resource record set\n\n*Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name*\n\nIf your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each `HTTP` server that is serving content for `www.example.com` . For the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , specify the domain name of the server (such as `us-east-2-www.example.com` ), not the name of the resource record sets ( `www.example.com` ).\n\n> Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:\n> \n> - Create a health check that has the same value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` as the name of a resource record set.\n> - Associate that health check with the resource record set.",
