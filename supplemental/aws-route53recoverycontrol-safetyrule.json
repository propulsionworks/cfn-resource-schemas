  "description": "Creates a safety rule in a control panel in Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller. Safety rules in Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller let you add safeguards around changing routing control states, and enabling and disabling routing controls, to help prevent unwanted outcomes. Note that the name of a safety rule must be unique within a control panel.\n\nThere are two types of safety rules in Route 53 ARC: assertion rules and gating rules.\n\nAssertion rule: An assertion rule enforces that, when you change a routing control state, certain criteria are met. For example, the criteria might be that at least one routing control state is `On` after the transaction completes so that traffic continues to be directed to at least one cell for the application. This prevents a fail-open scenario.\n\nGating rule: A gating rule lets you configure a gating routing control as an overall on-off switch for a group of routing controls. Or, you can configure more complex gating scenarios, for example, by configuring multiple gating routing controls.\n\nFor more information, see [Safety rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.safety-rules.html) in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.",
