  "description": "Creates a cell in recovery group in Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller. A cell in Route 53 ARC represents replicas or independent units of failover in your application. It groups within it all the AWS resources that are necessary for your application to run independently. Typically, you would have define one set of resources in a primary cell and another set in a standby cell in your recovery group.\n\nAfter you set up the cells for your application, you can create readiness checks in Route 53 ARC to continually audit readiness for AWS resource quotas, capacity, network routing policies, and other predefined rules.\n\nYou can set up notifications about changes that would affect your ability to fail over to a replica and recover. However, you should make decisions about whether to fail away from or to a replica based on your monitoring and health check systems. You should consider readiness checks as a complementary service to those systems.\n\nRoute 53 ARC Readiness supports us-east-1 and us-west-2 AWS Regions only.",
