For example, if the location scope is the default location `s3://` , the `S3SubPrefx` can be a `<bucket-name>/*` , so the full grant scope path would be `s3://<bucket-name>/*` . Or the `S3SubPrefx` can be `<bucket-name>/<prefix-name>*` , so the full grant scope path would be `s3://<bucket-name>/<prefix-name>*` .\n\nIf the `S3SubPrefix` includes a prefix, append the wildcard character `*` after the prefix to indicate that you want to include all object key names in the bucket that start with that prefix.",
