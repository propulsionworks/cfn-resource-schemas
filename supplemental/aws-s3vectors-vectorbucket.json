  "description": "Defines an Amazon S3 vector bucket in the same AWS Region where you create the AWS CloudFormation stack.\n\nVector buckets are specialized storage containers designed for storing and managing vector data used in machine learning and AI applications. They provide optimized storage and retrieval capabilities for high-dimensional vector data.\n\nTo control how AWS CloudFormation handles the bucket when the stack is deleted, you can set a deletion policy for your bucket. You can choose to *retain* the bucket or to *delete* the bucket. For more information, see [DeletionPolicy attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-deletionpolicy.html) .\n\n> You can only delete empty vector buckets. Deletion fails for buckets that have contents. \n\n- **Permissions** - The required permissions for CloudFormation to use are based on the operations that are performed on the stack.\n\n- Create\n\n- s3vectors:CreateVectorBucket\n- s3vectors:GetVectorBucket\n- kms:GenerateDataKey (if using KMS encryption)\n- Read\n\n- s3vectors:GetVectorBucket\n- kms:GenerateDataKey (if using KMS encryption)\n- Delete\n\n- s3vectors:DeleteVectorBucket\n- s3vectors:GetVectorBucket\n- kms:GenerateDataKey (if using KMS encryption)\n- List\n\n- s3vectors:ListVectorBuckets\n- kms:GenerateDataKey (if using KMS encryption)",
