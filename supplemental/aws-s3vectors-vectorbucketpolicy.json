  "description": "The `AWS::S3Vectors::VectorBucketPolicy` resource defines an Amazon S3 vector bucket policy to control access to an Amazon S3 vector bucket.\n\nVector bucket policies are written in JSON and allow you to grant or deny permissions across all (or a subset of) objects within a vector bucket.\n\nYou must specify either `VectorBucketName` or `VectorBucketArn` to identify the target bucket.\n\nTo control how AWS CloudFormation handles the vector bucket policy when the stack is deleted, you can set a deletion policy for your policy. You can choose to *retain* the policy or to *delete* the policy. For more information, see [DeletionPolicy attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-deletionpolicy.html) .\n\n- **Permissions** - The required permissions for CloudFormation to use are based on the operations that are performed on the stack.\n\n- Create\n\n- s3vectors:GetVectorBucketPolicy\n- s3vectors:PutVectorBucketPolicy\n- Read\n\n- s3vectors:GetVectorBucketPolicy\n- Update\n\n- s3vectors:GetVectorBucketPolicy\n- s3vectors:PutVectorBucketPolicy\n- Delete\n\n- s3vectors:GetVectorBucketPolicy\n- s3vectors:DeleteVectorBucketPolicy\n- List\n\n- s3vectors:GetVectorBucketPolicy\n- s3vectors:ListVectorBuckets",
