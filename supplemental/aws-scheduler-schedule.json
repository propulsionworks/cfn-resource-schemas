For more information about different schedule types, see [Schedule types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/scheduler/latest/UserGuide/schedule-types.html) in the *EventBridge Scheduler User Guide* .\n\nWhen you create a schedule, you configure a target for the schedule to invoke. A target is an API operation that EventBridge Scheduler calls on your behalf every time your schedule runs. EventBridge Scheduler supports two types of targets: *templated* targets invoke common API operations across a core groups of services, and customizeable *universal* targets that you can use to call more than 6,000 operations across over 270 services.
