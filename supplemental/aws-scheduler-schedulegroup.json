  "description": "A *schedule group* is an Amazon EventBridge Scheduler resource you use to organize your schedules.\n\nYour AWS account comes with a `default` scheduler group. You associate a new schedule with the `default` group or with schedule groups that you create and manage. You can create up to [500 schedule groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/scheduler/latest/UserGuide/scheduler-quotas.html) in your AWS account. With EventBridge Scheduler, you apply [tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) to schedule groups, not to individual schedules to organize your resources.\n\nFor more information about managing schedule groups, see [Managing a schedule group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/scheduler/latest/UserGuide/managing-schedule-group.html) in the *EventBridge Scheduler User Guide* .",
