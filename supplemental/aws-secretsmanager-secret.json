If the completion of this operation would result in you losing your permissions for this secret, then Secrets Manager blocks the operation and returns an `Access Denied` error.

You can't edit or delete tag names or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per secret limit.\n- If you use your tagging schema across multiple services and resources, other services might have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters: letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8, plus the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @.",
