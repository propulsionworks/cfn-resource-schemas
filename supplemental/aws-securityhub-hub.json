To disable default standards, set the `EnableDefaultStandards` property to `false` . You can use the [`AWS::SecurityHub::Standard`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-securityhub-standard.html) resource to enable additional standards.\n\nWhen you use this resource to enable Security Hub , new controls are automatically enabled for your enabled standards. To disable automatic enablement of new controls, set the `AutoEnableControls` property to `false` .\n\nYou must create an `AWS::SecurityHub::Hub` resource for an account before you can create other types of Security Hub resources for the account through AWS CloudFormation . Use a [DependsOn attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-dependson.html) , such as `\"DependsOn\": \"Hub\"` , to ensure that you've created an `AWS::SecurityHub::Hub` resource before creating other Security Hub resources for an account.",

However, automatically enabled controls have a temporary default status of `DISABLED` . It can take up to several days for Security Hub to process the control release and designate the control as `ENABLED` in your account. During the processing period, you can manually enable or disable a control, and Security Hub will maintain that designation regardless of whether you have `AutoEnableControls` set to `true` .",
