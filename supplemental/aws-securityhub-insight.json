For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department EQUALS Security` matches findings that have the value `Security` for the `Department` tag.\n\n`CONTAINS` and `EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Department CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance` match a finding that includes either `Security` , `Finance` , or both values.\n\nTo search for values that don't have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:\n\n- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance` matches findings that exclude the value `Finance` for the `Department` tag.\n- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department NOT_EQUALS Finance` matches findings that don’t have the value `Finance` for the `Department` tag.\n\n`NOT_CONTAINS` and `NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Department NOT_CONTAINS Security AND Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance` match a finding that excludes both the `Security` and `Finance` values.\n\n`CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.\n\nYou can’t have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you can’t have both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.\n\n`CONTAINS` and `NOT_CONTAINS` operators can be used only with automation rules.

For example, the filter `Title CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that includes the string CloudFront.\n- To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID of `123456789012` .\n- To search for values that start with the filter value, use `PREFIX` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX us` matches findings that have a `ResourceRegion` that starts with `us` . A `ResourceRegion` that starts with a different value, such as `af` , `ap` , or `ca` , doesn't match.\n\n`CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.\n\nTo search for values that don’t have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:\n\n- To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.\n- To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` .

Security Hub first processes the `PREFIX` filters, and then the `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters.\n\nFor example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either `AwsIam` or `AwsEc2` .
