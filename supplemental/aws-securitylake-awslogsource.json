  "description": "Adds a natively supported AWS service as an AWS source. Enables source types for member accounts in required AWS Regions, based on the parameters you specify. You can choose any source type in any Region for either accounts that are part of a trusted organization or standalone accounts. Once you add an AWS service as a source, Security Lake starts collecting logs and events from it.\n\n> If you want to create multiple sources using `AWS::SecurityLake::AwsLogSource` , you must use the `DependsOn` attribute to create the sources sequentially. With the `DependsOn` attribute you can specify that the creation of a specific `AWSLogSource` follows another. When you add a `DependsOn` attribute to a resource, that resource is created only after the creation of the resource specified in the `DependsOn` attribute. For an example, see [Add AWS log sources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-securitylake-awslogsource.html#aws-resource-securitylake-awslogsource--examples) .",
