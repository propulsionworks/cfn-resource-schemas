For information about pricing for health checks, see [Amazon Route 53 Pricing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/) .\n\nNote the following about configuring health checks.\n\n- **A and AAAA records** - If `DnsConfig` includes configurations for both `A` and `AAAA` records, AWS Cloud Map creates a health check that uses the IPv4 address to check the health of the resource. If the endpoint tthat's specified by the IPv4 address is unhealthy, Route 53 considers both the `A` and `AAAA` records to be unhealthy.\n- **CNAME records** - You can't specify settings for `HealthCheckConfig` when the `DNSConfig` includes `CNAME` for the value of `Type` . If you do, the `CreateService` request will fail with an `InvalidInput` error.\n- **Request interval** - A Route 53 health checker in each health-checking AWS Region sends a health check request to an endpoint every 30 seconds. On average, your endpoint receives a health check request about every two seconds. However, health checkers don't coordinate with one another. Therefore, you might sometimes see several requests in one second that's followed by a few seconds with no health checks at all.\n- **Health checking regions** - Health checkers perform checks from all Route 53 health-checking Regions. For a list of the current Regions, see [Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_HealthCheckConfig.html#Route53-Type-HealthCheckConfig-Regions) .\n- **Alias records** - When you register an instance, if you include the `AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME` attribute, AWS Cloud Map creates a Route 53 alias record. Note the following:\n\n- Route 53 automatically sets `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for alias records. When `EvaluateTargetHealth` is true, the alias record inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource. such as an ELB load balancer. For more information, see [EvaluateTargetHealth](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_AliasTarget.html#Route53-Type-AliasTarget-EvaluateTargetHealth) .\n- If you include `HealthCheckConfig` and then use the service to register an instance that creates an alias record, Route 53 doesn't create the health check.\n- **Charges for health checks** - Health checks are basic Route 53 health checks that monitor an AWS endpoint.
