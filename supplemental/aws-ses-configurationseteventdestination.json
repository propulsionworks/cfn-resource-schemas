( *Soft bounces* are only included when SES fails to deliver the email after retrying for a period of time.)\n- `COMPLAINT` - The email was successfully delivered to the recipient’s mail server, but the recipient marked it as spam.\n- `DELIVERY` - SES successfully delivered the email to the recipient's mail server.\n- `OPEN` - The recipient received the message and opened it in their email client.\n- `CLICK` - The recipient clicked one or more links in the email.\n- `RENDERING_FAILURE` - The email wasn't sent because of a template rendering issue. This event type can occur when template data is missing, or when there is a mismatch between template parameters and data. (This event type only occurs when you send email using the [`SendEmail`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference-V2/API_SendEmail.html) or [`SendBulkEmail`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference-V2/API_SendBulkEmail.html) API operations.)\n- `DELIVERY_DELAY` - The email couldn't be delivered to the recipient’s mail server because a temporary issue occurred. Delivery delays can occur, for example, when the recipient's inbox is full, or when the receiving email server experiences a transient issue.\n- `SUBSCRIPTION` - The email was successfully delivered, but the recipient updated their subscription preferences by clicking on an *unsubscribe* link as part of your [subscription management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/sending-email-subscription-management.html) .",
