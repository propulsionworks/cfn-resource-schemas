  "description": "Enables AWS Shield Advanced for a specific AWS resource. The resource can be an Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon Route 53 hosted zone, AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator, Elastic IP Address, Application Load Balancer, or a Classic Load Balancer. You can protect Amazon EC2 instances and Network Load Balancers by association with protected Amazon EC2 Elastic IP addresses.\n\n*Configure a single `AWS::Shield::Protection`*\n\nUse this protection to protect a single resource at a time.\n\nTo configure this Shield Advanced protection through AWS CloudFormation , you must be subscribed to Shield Advanced . You can subscribe through the [Shield Advanced console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/) and through the APIs. For more information, see [Subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/enable-ddos-prem.html) .\n\nSee example templates for Shield Advanced in AWS CloudFormation at [aws-samples/aws-shield-advanced-examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-shield-advanced-examples) .\n\n*Configure Shield Advanced using AWS CloudFormation and AWS Firewall Manager*\n\nYou might be able to use Firewall Manager with AWS CloudFormation to configure Shield Advanced across multiple accounts and protected resources. To do this, your accounts must be part of an organization in AWS Organizations . You can use Firewall Manager to configure Shield Advanced protections for any resource types except for Amazon Route 53 or AWS Global Accelerator .\n\nFor an example of this, see the one-click configuration guidance published by the AWS technical community at [One-click deployment of Shield Advanced](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://youtu.be/LCA3FwMk_QE) .\n\n*Configure multiple protections through the Shield Advanced console*\n\nYou can add protection to multiple resources at once through the [Shield Advanced console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/) .
