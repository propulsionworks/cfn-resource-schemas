This is a good choice for most cases. Examples include Elastic IP addresses for EC2 instances that scale manually or automatically.\n- `Mean` - Use the average of the traffic across the group. This is a good choice for resources that share traffic uniformly. Examples include accelerators and load balancers.\n- `Max` - Use the highest traffic from each resource. This is useful for resources that don't share traffic and for resources that share that traffic in a non-uniform way. Examples include Amazon CloudFront distributions and origin resources for CloudFront distributions.",
