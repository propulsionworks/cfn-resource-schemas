  "description": "Use the `AWS::SimSpaceWeaver::Simulation` resource to specify a simulation that AWS CloudFormation starts in the AWS Cloud , in your AWS account . In the resource properties section of your template, provide the name of an existing IAM role configured with the proper permissions, and the name of an existing Amazon S3 bucket. Your account must have permissions to read the Amazon S3 bucket. The Amazon S3 bucket must contain a valid schema. The schema must refer to simulation assets that are already uploaded to the AWS Cloud . For more information, see the [detailed tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/simspaceweaver/latest/userguide/getting-started_detailed.html) in the *AWS SimSpace Weaver User Guide* .\n\nSpecify a `SnapshotS3Location` to start a simulation from a snapshot instead of from a schema. When you start a simulation from a snapshot, SimSpace Weaver initializes the entity data in the State Fabric with data saved in the snapshot, starts the spatial and service apps that were running when the snapshot was created, and restores the clock to the appropriate tick. Your app zip files must be in the same location in Amazon S3 as they were in for the original simulation. You must start any custom apps separately.
