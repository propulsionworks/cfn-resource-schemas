  "description": "The `AWS::SSM::ResourceDataSync` resource creates, updates, or deletes a resource data sync for AWS Systems Manager . A resource data sync helps you view data from multiple sources in a single location. Systems Manager offers two types of resource data sync: `SyncToDestination` and `SyncFromSource` .\n\nYou can configure Systems Manager Inventory to use the `SyncToDestination` type to synchronize Inventory data from multiple AWS Regions to a single Amazon S3 bucket.\n\nYou can configure Systems Manager Explorer to use the `SyncFromSource` type to synchronize operational work items (OpsItems) and operational data (OpsData) from multiple AWS Regions . This type can synchronize OpsItems and OpsData from multiple AWS accounts and Regions or from an `EntireOrganization` by using AWS Organizations .\n\nA resource data sync is an asynchronous operation that returns immediately. After a successful initial sync is completed, the system continuously syncs data.\n\nBy default, data is not encrypted in Amazon S3 . We strongly recommend that you enable encryption in Amazon S3 to ensure secure data storage. We also recommend that you secure access to the Amazon S3 bucket by creating a restrictive bucket policy.\n\nFor more information, see [Configuring Inventory Collection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-inventory-configuring.html#sysman-inventory-datasync) and [Setting Up Systems Manager Explorer to Display Data from Multiple Accounts and Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/Explorer-resource-data-sync.html) in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide* .\n\n> The following *Syntax* section shows all fields that are supported for a resource data sync.
