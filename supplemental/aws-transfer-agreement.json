  "description": "Creates an agreement. An agreement is a bilateral trading partner agreement, or partnership, between an AWS Transfer Family server and an AS2 process. The agreement defines the file and message transfer relationship between the server and the AS2 process. To define an agreement, Transfer Family combines a server, local profile, partner profile, certificate, and other attributes.\n\nThe partner is identified with the `PartnerProfileId` , and the AS2 process is identified with the `LocalProfileId` .\n\n> Specify *either* `BaseDirectory` or `CustomDirectories` , but not both. Specifying both causes the command to fail.",

      "description": "Connectors are used to send files using either the AS2 or SFTP protocol. For the access role, provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Management role to use.\n\n*For AS2 connectors*\n\nWith AS2, you can send files by calling `StartFileTransfer` and specifying the file paths in the request parameter, `SendFilePaths` . We use the fileâ€™s parent directory (for example, for `--send-file-paths /bucket/dir/file.txt` , parent directory is `/bucket/dir/` ) to temporarily store a processed AS2 message file, store the MDN when we receive them from the partner, and write a final JSON file containing relevant metadata of the transmission. So, the `AccessRole` needs to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the file location used in the `StartFileTransfer` request. Additionally, you need to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the files that you intend to send with `StartFileTransfer` .\n\nIf you are using Basic authentication for your AS2 connector, the access role requires the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission for the secret. If the secret is encrypted using a customer-managed key instead of the AWS managed key in Secrets Manager, then the role also needs the `kms:Decrypt` permission for that key.\n\n*For SFTP connectors*\n\nMake sure that the access role provides read and write access to the parent directory of the file location that's used in the `StartFileTransfer` request. Additionally, make sure that the role provides `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission to AWS Secrets Manager .",
