The value `PassiveIp=AUTO` is assigned by default to FTP and FTPS type servers. In this case, the server automatically responds with one of the endpoint IPs within the PASV response. `PassiveIp=0.0.0.0` has a more unique application for its usage. For example, if you have a High Availability (HA) Network Load Balancer (NLB) environment, where you have 3 subnets, you can only specify a single IP address using the `PassiveIp` parameter. This reduces the effectiveness of having High Availability. In this case, you can specify `PassiveIp=0.0.0.0` . This tells the client to use the same IP address as the Control connection and utilize all AZs for their connections. Note, however, that not all FTP clients support the `PassiveIp=0.0.0.0` response.
