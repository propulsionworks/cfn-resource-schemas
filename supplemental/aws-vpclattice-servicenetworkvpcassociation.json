If the association fails, retry by deleting the association and recreating it.\n\nAs a result of this operation, the association gets created in the service network account and the VPC owner account.\n\nIf you add a security group to the service network and VPC association, the association must continue to always have at least one security group. You can add or edit security groups at any time. However, to remove all security groups, you must first delete the association and recreate it without security groups.",
