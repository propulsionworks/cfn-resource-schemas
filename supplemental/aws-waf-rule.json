For example, you might create a `Rule` that includes the following predicates:\n\n- An `IPSet` that causes AWS WAF to search for web requests that originate from the IP address `192.0.2.44`\n- A `ByteMatchSet` that causes AWS WAF to search for web requests for which the value of the `User-Agent` header is `BadBot` .\n\nTo match the settings in this `Rule` , a request must originate from `192.0.2.44` AND include a `User-Agent` header for which the value is `BadBot` .",
