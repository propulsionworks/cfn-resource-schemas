  "description": "> This is *AWS WAF Classic* documentation. For more information, see [AWS WAF Classic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/classic-waf-chapter.html) in the developer guide.\n> \n> *For the latest version of AWS WAF* , use the AWS WAF V2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use. \n\nA `RateBasedRule` is identical to a regular `Rule` , with one addition: a `RateBasedRule` counts the number of requests that arrive from a specified IP address every five minutes. For example, based on recent requests that you've seen from an attacker, you might create a `RateBasedRule` that includes the following conditions:\n\n- The requests come from 192.0.2.44.\n- They contain the value `BadBot` in the `User-Agent` header.\n\nIn the rule, you also define the rate limit as 15,000.\n\nRequests that meet both of these conditions and exceed 15,000 requests every five minutes trigger the rule's action (block or count), which is defined in the web ACL.\n\nNote you can only create rate-based rules using an AWS CloudFormation template. To add the rate-based rules created through AWS CloudFormation to a web ACL, use the AWS WAF console, API, or command line interface (CLI).
