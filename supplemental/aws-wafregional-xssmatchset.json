If you choose `HEADER` for the type, specify the name of the header in `Data` .\n- `METHOD` : The HTTP method, which indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.\n- `QUERY_STRING` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.\n- `URI` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg` .\n- `BODY` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first `8192` bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set.\n- `SINGLE_QUERY_ARG` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for `SINGLE_QUERY_ARG` is 30 characters.\n- `ALL_QUERY_ARGS` : Similar to `SINGLE_QUERY_ARG` , but rather than inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value or regex pattern that you specify in `TargetString` .",
