As part of the association, you can specify parts of the standard logging fields to keep out of the logs and you can specify filters so that you log only a subset of the logging records.\n\nIf you configure data protection for the web ACL, the protection applies to the data that AWS WAF sends to the logs.\n\n> You can define one logging destination per web ACL. \n\nYou can access information about the traffic that AWS WAF inspects using the following steps:\n\n- Create your logging destination. You can use an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group, an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, or an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.\n\nThe name that you give the destination must start with `aws-waf-logs-` . Depending on the type of destination, you might need to configure additional settings or permissions.\n\nFor configuration requirements and pricing information for each destination type, see [Logging web ACL traffic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html) in the *AWS WAF Developer Guide* .\n- Associate your logging destination to your web ACL using a `PutLoggingConfiguration` request.\n\nWhen you successfully enable logging using a `PutLoggingConfiguration` request, AWS WAF creates an additional role or policy that is required to write logs to the logging destination. For an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group, AWS WAF creates a resource policy on the log group. For an Amazon S3 bucket, AWS WAF creates a bucket policy. For an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, AWS WAF creates a service-linked role.\n\nFor additional information about web ACL logging, see [Logging web ACL traffic information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html) in the *AWS WAF Developer Guide* .",
