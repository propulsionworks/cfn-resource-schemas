Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more processing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation, which helps users plan their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule group. The WCU limit for web ACLs is 1,500."

The rule categorizes requests according to your aggregation criteria, collects them into aggregation instances, and counts and rate limits the requests for each instance.\n\n> If you change any of these settings in a rule that's currently in use, the change resets the rule's rate limiting counts. This can pause the rule's rate limiting activities for up to a minute. \n\nYou can specify individual aggregation keys, like IP address or HTTP method. You can also specify aggregation key combinations, like IP address and HTTP method, or HTTP method, query argument, and cookie.\n\nEach unique set of values for the aggregation keys that you specify is a separate aggregation instance, with the value from each key contributing to the aggregation instance definition.\n\nFor example, assume the rule evaluates web requests with the following IP address and HTTP method values:\n\n- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST\n- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET\n- IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST\n- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET\n\nThe rule would create different aggregation instances according to your aggregation criteria, for example:\n\n- If the aggregation criteria is just the IP address, then each individual address is an aggregation instance, and AWS WAF counts requests separately for each. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:\n\n- IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3\n- IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1\n- If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP method is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:\n\n- HTTP method POST: count 2\n- HTTP method GET: count 2\n- If the aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each IP address and each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:\n\n- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1\n- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2\n- IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count 1\n\nFor any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for the keys defines a separate aggregation instance, which AWS WAF counts and rate-limits individually.\n\nYou can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule.\n\nYou cannot nest a `RateBasedStatement` inside another statement, for example inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You can define a `RateBasedStatement` inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.\n\nFor additional information about the options, see [Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html) in the *AWS WAF Developer Guide* .\n\nIf you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that AWS WAF is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call `GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys` .

You can also specify aggregation key combinations, like IP address and HTTP method, or HTTP method, query argument, and cookie.\n\nEach unique set of values for the aggregation keys that you specify is a separate aggregation instance, with the value from each key contributing to the aggregation instance definition.\n\nFor example, assume the rule evaluates web requests with the following IP address and HTTP method values:\n\n- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST\n- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET\n- IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST\n- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET\n\nThe rule would create different aggregation instances according to your aggregation criteria, for example:\n\n- If the aggregation criteria is just the IP address, then each individual address is an aggregation instance, and AWS WAF counts requests separately for each. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:\n\n- IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3\n- IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1\n- If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP method is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:\n\n- HTTP method POST: count 2\n- HTTP method GET: count 2\n- If the aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each IP address and each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:\n\n- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1\n- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2\n- IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count 1\n\nFor any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for the keys defines a separate aggregation instance, which AWS WAF counts and rate-limits individually.\n\nYou can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule.\n\nYou cannot nest a `RateBasedStatement` inside another statement, for example inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You can define a `RateBasedStatement` inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.\n\nFor additional information about the options, see [Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html) in the *AWS WAF Developer Guide* .\n\nIf you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that AWS WAF is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call `GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys` . This option is not available for other aggregation configurations.\n\nAWS WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF . If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF .",

Each rule in a web ACL has a statement that defines what to look for in web requests and an action that AWS WAF applies to requests that match the statement. In the web ACL, you assign a default action to take (allow, block) for any request that doesn't match any of the rules.\n\nThe rules in a web ACL can be a combination of explicitly defined rules and rule groups that you reference from the web ACL. The rule groups can be rule groups that you manage or rule groups that are managed by others.\n\nYou can associate a web ACL with one or more AWS resources to protect. The resources can be an Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer , an AWS AppSync GraphQL API , an Amazon Cognito user pool, an AWS App Runner service, an AWS Amplify application, or an AWS Verified Access instance.\n\nFor more information, see [Web access control lists (web ACLs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl.html) in the *AWS WAF developer guide* .\n\n*Web ACLs used in AWS Shield Advanced automatic application layer DDoS mitigation*\n\nIf you use Shield Advanced automatic application layer DDoS mitigation, the web ACLs that you use with automatic mitigation have a rule group rule whose name starts with `ShieldMitigationRuleGroup` .

You can add up to 50 tags to each AWS resource.\n\n> To modify tags on existing resources, use the AWS WAF APIs or command line interface.

When AWS WAF provides a token, it uses the domain of the AWS resource that the web ACL is protecting. If you don't specify a list of token domains, AWS WAF accepts tokens only for the domain of the protected resource. With a token domain list, AWS WAF accepts the resource's host domain plus all domains in the token domain list, including their prefixed subdomains.",
